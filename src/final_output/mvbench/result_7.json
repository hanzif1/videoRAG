Odd things occurred for a while but that was linked to something else. This is odd enough for me to post about. In the last 4 months - I have taken probably 200 videos. There is a green orb floating around in 4 of those. One was taken at night, two during the day and one through a glass window. I experimented with following it (to see if it was a defect in the camera) but it bounces around and will disappear eventually.

Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

Physics I had a debate with a co-worker in which he said that an object can move relative to itself. That an object can be its own frame of reference. We were talking about the Sun as it moves through the galaxy. We of course went through the obligatory acknowledgement that the galaxy itself is moving through the universe and so on. However when I said that even the sun’s rotation could only be described as it related to other objects, he disagreed and said that an object could be movin..."

Very similar to Mario World from Wii - I have a sphere (earth) and I want little objects to basically walk around on the surface. At first I have the “earth” sphere at 0,0,0 and had the “people” under the “earth’s” hierarchy. I then used a transform.rotatearound(vector3.zero…) but that won’t work when I want the “people” to turn and walk on an angle. Can anyone provide a suggestion? Is there a way to say the “people” should use “earth” as the gravity point? anon_57994679 April 11, 2012, 1:55am 2 The way I would do it is with trigonometry (unless someone has a better built-in solution). //this is if you are coding in Javascript...C# shouldn't be much different #pragma strict; var prefab:Transform; var centerX:float=100.0; //feel free to change these number..."

Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

The visibility between the observer and multiple target points is calculated using the currently displayed content in the view, including ground, integrated meshes, and 3D objects, such as buildings or trees. The line of sight analysis appears as lines and spheres: green lines are the visible part that the observer can see, and red lines are the occluded part. Also, green spheres indicate visible targets in which the full line is green, and red spheres indicate the occluded targets. When the line of sight can't be calculated, it is displayed with a gray color. This occurs when either the target or the observer are not in the view, or when neither of them are in the view.Create..."

Physics I had a debate with a co-worker in which he said that an object can move relative to itself. That an object can be its own frame of reference. We were talking about the Sun as it moves through the galaxy. We of course went through the obligatory acknowledgement that the galaxy itself is moving through the universe and so on. However when I said that even the sun’s rotation could only be described as it related to other objects, he disagreed and said that an object could be movin..."

Very similar to Mario World from Wii - I have a sphere (earth) and I want little objects to basically walk around on the surface. At first I have the “earth” sphere at 0,0,0 and had the “people” under the “earth’s” hierarchy. I then used a transform.rotatearound(vector3.zero…) but that won’t work when I want the “people” to turn and walk on an angle. Can anyone provide a suggestion? Is there a way to say the “people” should use “earth” as the gravity point? anon_57994679 April 11, 2012, 1:55am 2 The way I would do it is with trigonometry (unless someone has a better built-in solution). //this is if you are coding in Javascript...C# shouldn't be much different #pragma strict; var prefab:Transform; var centerX:float=100.0; //feel free to change these number..."

I want to model simple (or more complicated) things based on cylinders sooo I use cylinders for starting shape. The pic shows what happend to the default cylinder while only scaling down by a scale factor 0.3 on X and Z: More explanations: the big cylinder is just the default cylinder w/o any resizing. The cylinder at the back is resized and subsurfed with its vertices at front and back circles duplicated to retain the form. And the small cylinder, which is at front, is only re-sized… All cylinder are “set smooth”. At all cylinder I have recalculated normals but, nevertheless, the surface of the small cylinder w/o subsurf looks quite bad :shock: Because I have not twisted it nor applied anything else after creating the default cylinder there, except the scaling, I wonder what may be the problem?..."

In my sci fi project, the entry/exit of an O'Neill Cylinder just became rather important. I was vague about it before, but now I have to get specific. Hopefully this is the proper place to ask or is something you guys are interested in, as it's almost a physics question. I think it also qualifies as a good sci fi writing question, because creativity and imagination are also involved. If you're unfamiliar, an O'Neill Cylinder is a gigantic, theoretical space habitat in..."

Anonymous 2013-02-18T09:14:25+00:00 I have an interesting application where I have several video clips to be organized into a movie show. I have put video clip1 in slide1, video clip2 in slide 2 etc. Scene1 in video clip1 will play and when it ends, automatically scene2 from video clip2 should start. This approach is very helpful in editing the movie and experimenting with different scenes  in different sequences. Also, slide transition can be used with animations.

I’m trying to create a cylinder with differant dimensions at both ends. Like a funnel. So at one end I want the radius to be 10cm and at the other end I want it to be 15cm. I cant seem to find how to adjust the dimensions at the other end. Thanks for the help! Victor_Shapr3D October 11, 2019, 8:20am 2 Hi, welcome to the forum. You can create the cylinder using the Extrude Tool and then adjust its Draft Angle to get a different dimension on the other end - then rescale the sides of the cylinder to get a funnel shape.

Help Programming gdscript, godot-4, game, 3d marcythejinx November 2, 2025, 4:55pm 1 Godot Version v4.5.1 stable Question Hi! I’m working on a top-down 3D game and I’m having some trouble to try and find out the best way to prevent my player character from walking off a ledge. I tried using a raycast in front of the player at first, and if the raycast isn’t hitting anything stop the player from moving, but it posed some issues. If the player jumps right on the ledge or tries walking along the ledge the raycast won’t be hitting, preventing movement, but the player collision is still big enough for the player to keep standing on the ledge, which feels really janky. Basically, I need the player to be able to easily walk up to and along a ledge but not off of it. Any possible solutions? Edit: I should add that I don’t want to use invisible walls or s..."

However this yellow tint most often appeared in films from 2007 across all genres. Here are some examples: Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) I Am Legend (2007) Saw IV (2007) 1408 (2007) Transformers (2007) Mr. Bean’s Holiday (2007) Was this a trend in 2007? Read more Sh..."

In my sci fi project, the entry/exit of an O'Neill Cylinder just became rather important. I was vague about it before, but now I have to get specific. Hopefully this is the proper place to ask or is something you guys are interested in, as it's almost a physics question. I think it also qualifies as a good sci fi writing question, because creativity and imagination are also involved.

I’m trying to create a cylinder with differant dimensions at both ends. Like a funnel. So at one end I want the radius to be 10cm and at the other end I want it to be 15cm. I cant seem to find how to adjust the dimensions at the other end. Thanks for the help! Victor_Shapr3D October 11, 2019, 8:20am 2 Hi, welcome to the forum. You can create the cylinder using the Extrude Tool and then adjust its Draft Angle to get a different dimension on the other end - then rescale the sides of the cylinder to get a funnel shape.

The apparatus consists of two upright, concentric cylinders; the outer cylinder is fixed, and the inner one rotates. This video shows the gap between the cylinders, and it’s rotated so that the inner cylinder is at the bottom of the frame. Gravity points from left to right in the video. The fluid in the 8-cm gap between the cylinders is water, seeded with rheoscopic particles to visualize the flow.The video begins as the inner cylinder has just begun to rotate, dragging nearby fluid with it. A thin, laminar boundary layer forms at the bottom of the frame, growing as time goes on. A few seconds in, the boundary layer transitions to turbulence; look closely and you’ll see hairpin-shaped vortices appear. Just after that, the boundary layer becomes entirely turbulent and con..."

This is the very first post in my blog in English. I usually write articles only in Japanese, but this time I’ve decided to write the article in English as well, because I couldn’t find any relevant post even in English.

Have you ever tried to make a chain or a rope in Unity, ended up getting rigid bodies violently moving around just like the image above? Well, I have too. This post explains techniques to calm down jittering joints, digging into the systems of physics engines to reveal what truly make them jittery, and why the techniques are so effective. Making an actual scene I made this sim..."

Blodgett Handle Green Screen with Green Objects in foreground Sun Jun 16, 2019 11:14 pm I have no problem pulling my keys and getting background, etc using several different methods. We had a great setup for my son to do an unboxing of toys for YouTube videos. Unfortunately, some of the tiny toys ended up being almost the exact same shade of green as the green screen.He basically holds up the item (mostly in front of his body), then places it on a table.

Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

Analysts classify fingerprints into three categories according to the type of surface on which they are found and whether they are visible or not: Fingerprints on soft surfaces (such as soap, wax, wet paint, fresh caulk, etc.) are likely to be three-dimensional plastic prints; those on hard surfaces are either patent (visible) or latent (invisible) prints. Visible prints are formed when blood, dirt, ink, paint, etc., is transferred from a finger or thumb to a surface. Patent prints can be found on a wide variety of surfaces: smooth or rough, porous (such as paper, cloth or wood) or nonporous (such as metal, glass or plastic). Latent prints are formed when the body’s natural oils and sweat on the skin are deposited onto another surface. Latent prints can be found on a variety of ..."

An elaborate ribbon curled throughout her hair and she was beautiful, not like a piece of art but like the Milky Way. Beautiful and terrible to behold. Looking into her amethyst gaze, one feels they may become eclipsed. We never found out where she came from. When we tried to remember, we could not recall a time she hadn’t been there in the first place. She is our queen. When she declared we were all to wear lavender robes, to burn the possessions that previously weighed us down, we rejoiced.

M. Night Shyamalan has gathered a bad rep since The Village, as made clear by articles on the interweb such as this one, and to be honest, there’s been enough written on how dire a director he is. I’m personally a bit tired of it all. I think I’m one of the only people who actually liked The Village, and who thought The Happening was hilarious and therefore incredibly enjoyable (who can deny the comic genius of the plastic plant scene?) But this isn’t going to be a defence of Shyamalan. That would probably take too long. I’d have to engage in existing arguments, and watch The ..."

Okay, for the typical person, probably not all of those thoughts creep in, but for those of you who appreciate the beauty of cinematography, and consider yourself to be a connoisseur of art , you can appreciate the most basic principles of film. Color is one of them. There are a bunch of colors that are used in film today. These colors are used in correspondence with one another or, in stand alone to captivate an audience, to truly mesmerize them in hopes of successfully delivering the emotion of choice you’re trying to cultivate with a particular scene.

Blood contains both liquid (plasma and serum) and solids (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and proteins). Blood is in a liquid state when inside the body, and when it exits the body, it does so as a liquid. But as anyone who has had a cut or a scrape knows, it doesn’t remain a liquid for long. Except for people with hemophilia, blood will begin to clot within a few minutes, forming a dark, shiny gel-like substance that grows more solid as time progresses. The presence of blood clots in bloodstains can indicate that the attack was prolonged, or that the victim was bleeding for some time after the injury occurred. Blood can leave the body in many different ways, depending on the type of injury inflicted. It can flow, drip, spray, spurt, gus..."

We currently have a few different options: Search for the object using things like GameObject.Find: obviously terrible in terms of both performance and maintainability. Instantiate the object from a prefab: less terrible, but now I have to go through the extra steps of making everything I want to reference a prefab. I still also need a way of referencing the parent object that I want to instantiate my object inside of - which generally means making the parent object a prefab as well. Ultimately pretty much the entire scene ends up being a giant prefab that gets instantiated at runtime. If you want to get references to objects nested inside of these prefabs, you have to..."

The catch is, I do not generate all the objects programmatically in the python script, so I don’t know how many objects there are and what their names are. Is there a possibility to get a list of objects in a scene? The information exists in the SceneRegistry, e.g. for rigid objects. I just don’t know how I can access it from the scene class, since there is only a function to get information about a specific object when you know the name of the object. clemens.linnhoff1 July 31, 2023, 9:47am 2 I figured it out.

I did this for example to list all the scene camera’s with scene.cameras Is there a way in threejs to do the same? I know you can traverse the scene each time, but I would prefer to be able to use a direct category class to access all the camera’s, meshes, etc… Thanks Pieter PavelBoytchev July 12, 2023, 7:03pm 2 Cameras are not required to be elements of scenes – i.e. from JavaScript point of view, they are independent objects. However, you can add the cameras to the scene (or to other objects). In this case, the list of cameras can be extracted by: var allCameras = scene.getObjectsByProperty( 'isCamera', true ); This traverses the scene. You might want to set allCameras once, and then reuse it. In c..."

I just finished all of the Cosmere so far. I was reading about some of the connections I'd missed. (I started with Stormlight, which I now realize was a mistake.

While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

My husband saw 30-40 of these on the ground near a hospital loading dock while taking photos of a building opposite the hospital. They’re each about an inch long. He picked a couple up (he often picks up trash, plastic, metal etc. to take home and dispose or recycle) and he said they had some weight to them (so not hollow), but then got weirded out because they were near the hospital and thought they could be medical, so he left them where they were. He’s still curious what they might be, though. Anyone recognize them? Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be..."
