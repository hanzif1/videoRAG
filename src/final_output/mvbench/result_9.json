Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

The thing in question starts at the bottom of the screen. If you watch till the end it quadruples in size and looks like it trying to grow wings or some shit. I've had cameras for many years and I'm a very paranoid and nervous individual so I have stared at these cameras more than I'd ever like to admit. I've seen lots of things and they always can either be explained away or was the result of a hallucination from some kind of hallucinogen but I've never seen this before. This video was a week ago.

It was moving west to east at a fast pace and made an erratic turn before suddenly disappearing. I didn’t even have time to grab a video while I was trying to point it out to her. It happened at around 6:20 PM. None of the obvious red/..."

They rotate using a matrix. I tried to do the same way and it works but super slow. For 40 objects in FixedUpdated it destroys my FPS on mobile. Is there a faster way to get a direction on a sphere?

Members • DCJGaming Español (Latinoamérica) Return actor(s) in direction of mouse movement - help I'm making a hockey game. The player with the puck can pass the puck to other players. The direction of the puck is based off the mouse movement / right analog stick. So if you move the mouse/stick up, you pass the puck up, etc.I'd like to add in some sort of \"auto aim assist\". What im struggling with is the best way to get an actor in that direction. I've played around with traces, line & sphere. But what I don't like about the line is it has to be so dead on. It's just a line after all. And what I've noticed with the sphere is you still have to make the sphere really big for it to work right, and the issue is t..."

There are different theories about what it means if you see an orb.I’ve never experienced one myself, but I’d heard the word flying around (no pun intended) and read about them in Wayne Dyer’s book, Wishes Fulfilled, where he shows a series of photos of his family with clear, white circles of light captured next to them.Depending on who you’re talking to about this, you’ll hear different things – so the most important thing is to discern what it means for you. Does it feel like a sign? An optical illusion from the photography process? Or a visit from the spirit of a passed loved one?The context can also give you the answer you’re looking for. For example, the colour of the orb, whether it was seen in real life or in a photo, and the situation it was spotted in.Take your own meaning from this information, and see which answer feels..."

Brief Overview Hey all! After observing the hype around the reappearance of Kevin and the other Cubes, we have decided to create a Megathread to talk about and track their movements. At the start of this new season, three types of Cube have appeared on the map: the Purple Cubes, the Blue Cube, and the Gold Cube.

Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

Tenenbaum MIT BCS, CBMM, CSAIL indicates equal contributions. Project page: http://clevrer.csail.mit.edu/ Abstract The ability to reason about temporal and causal events from videos lies at the core of human intelligence. Most video reasoning benchmarks, however, focus on pattern recognition from complex visual and language input, instead of on causal structure. We study the complementary problem, exploring the temporal and causal structures behind videos of objects with simple visual appearance. To this end, we introduce the CoLlision Events for Video REpresentation and Reasoning (CLEVRER) dataset, a diagnostic video dataset for systematic evaluation of computati..."

Currently my marble moves by adding force to the global axes regardless of rotation of the camera so it’s really odd. For example if the camera is looking at -Y direction and I press the up arrow key to go forward the marble goes towards the camera to the +Y direction. I need it go -Y direction where the camera is pointing. Here’s a video I found that has the type of movement I need. Also it appears that my camera is not 100% fixed to the center of the marble but rather waves around slightly when moving. Again see the video. eyelight (eyelight) August 20, 2011, 10:44am 2 DataNalle\": if the camera is looking at -Y direction ..."

I was taught these principles, I’ve been building on them for 25 years, and I’m now going to pass them on to you. These truly are the laws of light, the things that happen every time you turn on a light.

This actually works quite well. Camera and Target animation using Bongo for Rhino. Create a Sphere for the Camera and a cube for the Target Rename a Perspective viewport as “Camera” using the “NamedVIew” command. Go to the Bongo “View Constraints Manager” . Press “+” to add a view constraint to the “Camera” viewport Assign Target to the Target Cube and assign Camera to the Camera Sphere using “Add Constraint”.

If yes can figure it out just by looking at the cubes rotation. Otherwise if you could use a raycast from the camera and its hit info to get the triangle I’d or the UV coord of the hit, and keep a list of what color each triangle is to reference back.

Back in July, we took a family trip to my in-laws. In one of the piles of toys that is inevitably left with the grandparents, I found a Rubik’s cube. Like everyone, I’ve tried to solve the cube a handful of times in my life and never got far. For whatever reason this time I decided I was going to get it done. I hopped around the web before settling on a tutorial video from Wired. I watched and rewatched the video as I turned the cube, slowing down and replaying to help me get the hang of it. After a little over an hour, with my phone in one hand and the cube in the other, I had solved it. Soon enough you’ll be able to read cube notationAll Rubik’s Cubes have the same basic design, and that design is central to understanding how to solve it. They are built around a core, which holds the six center bl..."

I rotate the second circle 90 degrees with the rotation tool, then right arrow. Then I select the outline edge of the first circle. I select the Follow Me tool. I click on the second circle interior (not edge). Boom. The second circle is now a sphere. I delete the first circle. Now, how do I find the centre of this sphere? Elmtec-Adam October 13, 2023, 3:04pm 2 Good question! You might be better off finding the centre of the circle before you make the sphere.

Tenenbaum Chuang Gan Abstract Objects’ motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object’s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual app..."

Support Animation and Rigging Atom (Atom) February 27, 2010, 8:47am 1 Hi All, I have a sphere with a texture map. I would like to somehow morph the sphere into a plane. The concept here is a sphere with videos running in all the little faces of the sphere. Then as the sphere moves toward the camera, the sphere flattens out and becomes a plane with the videos still running. Can Blender do something like this? Feeding a Particle Simulation or Geometry Nodes with a Table of Coordinates TheRiddler (TheRiddler) February 27, 2010, 10:30am 2 Hey Atom, This might not be precisely what you’re looking for, but in the attached blend I’ve created half a really imprecise sphere from one plane modified with two arrays and two curves… and I’m sure with what I’ve seen of your knowledge you’d be able to animate it flattening (Thi..."

Odd things occurred for a while but that was linked to something else. This is odd enough for me to post about. In the last 4 months - I have taken probably 200 videos. There is a green orb floating around in 4 of those. One was taken at night, two during the day and one through a glass window. I experimented with following it (to see if it was a defect in the camera) but it bounces around and will disappear eventually.
