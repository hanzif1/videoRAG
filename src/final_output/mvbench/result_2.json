Nummer, Ph.D. National Center for Home Food Preservation May 2002 Introduction The astonishing fact about food preservation is that it permeated every culture at nearly every moment in time.

Food by its nature begins to spoil the moment it is harvested. Food preservation enabled ancient man to make roots and live in one place and form a community.

HomeAbout Comments policy Editing and proofreading Reading the book before seeing the film Pauline Kael in Going Steady (1970), a collection of her film reviews for the New Yorker, writes about something of perennial interest to book-readers and film-watchers:* If you’re going to see a movie based on a book you think is worth reading, read the book first. You can never read the book with the same imaginative responsiveness to the author once you have seen the movie. The great French film critic André Bazin believed that even if movies vulgarized and distorted books they served a useful purpose, because they led people to read the books on which the movies were based.

Her mother asked her one evening, “Is it to let the light in?” The little girl thought about it for a moment and then replied, “No, Mummy. I think it is to let the darkness out.” Grief is a bundle of quite complex negative emotions. It is a bit like darkness inside. It needs to be let out—it needs to be expressed in whatever way is appropriate to our own personality and temperament when the time comes.

June 4, 2021 Question: Good day. I have an argument with a Catholic defender on social media about Sola Scriptura. I used Revelation 20:12 that the written word will judge us in the last days.

Please help me with this. I researched it and found some commentators pro..."

Now whilst it would be nice if we could meet up with our exes and get that closure so many of us seek, the fact of the matter is that you are far more likely to leave with more questions than answers, which could effectively set you back.

Her mother asked her one evening, “Is it to let the light in?” The little girl thought about it for a moment and then replied, “No, Mummy. I think it is to let the darkness out.” Grief is a bundle of quite complex negative emotions. It is a bit like darkness inside. It needs to be let out—it needs to be expressed in whatever way is appropriate to our own personality and temperament when the time comes. When grief comes upon us, as surely it will (and probably it will come a number of times) in the course of our lifetime, we need to open the door, and keep the door open for long enough for the grief (the darkness)..."

I have supported many, many, many dying patients. Although every human dies in their own unique way, most experience the following typical sign and symptoms in the last week of their life. Most hospice patients go through two subtle but visible stages as they are dying: the Transitioning Stage and the Actively Dying Stage. If you are the primary caregiver for a hospice patient, you may want to know when death is imminent so you can be present for your loved one as they breathe their last breath. Hospice nurses are always asked “how long?” This is what I learned from my mentors, fellow nurses, CNAs, physicians, and my patients. Transi..."

One of them is Elf, the other is A Charlie Brown Christmas. This past Sunday I preached a message titled “Paradoxes and Promises” from Luke 2:8-38. The beginning of that text is the famous Christmas passage about the angelic announcement of Jesus’ birth to the shepherds who were watching their flocks in a nearby field – the same text that Linus reads at the end of A Charlie Brown Christmas. I mentioned in my sermon some interesting things I had learned about the film, particularly that Charles Schulz, creator of the Peanuts comic strip, was a devout Christian,  and when he was asked in 1965 to create a Christmas special for CBS featuring the ..."

In the past, an author was allowed the luxury of giving the reader details right away about the main character’s past, sometimes even going back to their birth and childhood.

I find opening scenes both easy and hard to write. Once I’m ready to write them they’re easy, but it might take me a month or more to figure out the right opening line. And I can’t write the novel until I have the right opening line and scene. I need to start off from the right point or I tend to wander into the weeds. Other writers don’t have this issue, and write whatever comes to them, knowing they’re going to revise it later. They don’t know what the right opening scene is until they write the final scene. Both (and everything in between), are perfectly acceptable ways to write opening scenes. Which is good, because opening scenes need to do a lot. They ..."

We don’t even stop to think about it. But just a few decades ago, taking a photo was a whole event. You needed a proper camera, film, maybe a flash, and definitely a lot of patience. You’d take a photo, wait days for it to be developed, and only then find out if someone blinked or not. The idea that you could take a picture with your phone would’ve sounded like science fiction. But here we are—and it didn’t happen overnight. Before camera phones existed, cameras and phones were totally separate things. Mobile phones in the 90s were mostly for making calls or sending texts.

By Beth Porter Source: David Bokuchava When we clean out our closets, we often use three piles for clothing: keep, donate, and toss (or, landfill). Even though many Americans donate clothes, textiles still make up a shocking amount of the U.S. waste stream. The EPA reports that Americans generate 17 million tons of textile waste a year, equaling just over 6% of total municipal waste. On average, 700,000 tons of used clothing gets exported overseas and 2.5 million tons of clothing are recycled. But over three million tons are incinerated,..."

They both ordered the same dish from the menu. After they tasted it, one of the men went outside the restaurant and shot himself. Why? Answer The dish that the two men ordered was albatross. They had been stranded many years earlier on a desert island. When the man tasted albatross he realised that he had never tasted it before. This meant that the meat he had been given on the island was not albatross as he had been told. He correctly deduced that he had eaten the flesh of his son who had died when they first reached the island. This has something in common with The Arm of the Postal Service but is in my opinion even better. It is fiendishly difficult to figure out from a standing start. A beautiful aspect of this problem is the subtle fact that he shot himself because he did not r..."

The set phrase, to achieve both fame and wealth, gives the true meaning of the word fame. Only when people are famous worldwide have they laid the foundation to achieve great wealth. The owners of many famous restaurants throughout the dynasties won praise from their customers for their good service and became famous. This, in turn, brought them more customers and still better business. Among them are the Donglaishun, Quanjude, and Hongbinlou restaurants in Beijng, the Songhelou Restaurant in Suzhou, the laozhengxing Restaurant in Shanghai, the Goubuli Restaurant in Tianjin, and the Juchunyuan Restaurant in Fuzhou. Of course, the pre-requisites for the restaurants being well known were their delicious food, fair prices, and honesty, or they would not have been famous.

We don’t even stop to think about it. But just a few decades ago, taking a photo was a whole event. You needed a proper camera, film, maybe a flash, and definitely a lot of patience. You’d take a photo, wait days for it to be developed, and only then find out if someone blinked or not. The idea that you could take a picture with your phone would’ve sounded like science fiction. But here we are—and it didn’t happen overnight. Before camera phones existed, cameras and phones were totally separate things. Mobile phones in the 90s were mostly for making calls or sending texts. Meanwhile, cameras were either bulky film ones or, if you were fancy, early digital cameras that saved photos on memory cards. They weren’t cheap, and they weren’..."

Anthropology It seems like we can’t go more than 7 or 8 hours before we start to get hungry for food and I imagine constant hunting would be a drain on the surrounding ecosystem no matter where you are. Even if a boar, or whatever, could feed a village/tribe on its meat alone, that is only going to stay good for consumption for so long and has its own risks for hunting it. I’m seriously amazed we as a species managed to survive in the wilderness with our caloric re..."

Nummer, Ph.D. National Center for Home Food Preservation May 2002 Introduction The astonishing fact about food preservation is that it permeated every culture at nearly every moment in time. To survive ancient man had to harness nature. In frozen climates he froze seal meat on the ice. In tropical climates he dried foods in the sun. Food by its nature begins to spoil the moment it is harvested. Food preservation enabled ancient man to make roots and live in one place and form a community. He no longer had to consume the kill or harvest immediately, but could pre..."

Preserving food at home continues to be a very popular area of interest. Educators and home food preservers witnessed this enormous interest in home food preservation in 2020, when the lack of canning supplies like jar lids and canners became a reality.

That roughly means that each individual person took around 160 photos throughout 2017. In 2016, the total was one billion less. This exponential increase in the number of photos taken comes down to only one thing. Of all those photos, 85% of them were taken with a smartphone. This smartphone photo epidemic is due to the development of both technology and the internet. First, cell phone cameras have improved dramatic..."

They both ordered the same dish from the menu. After they tasted it, one of the men went outside the restaurant and shot himself. Why? Answer The dish that the two men ordered was albatross. They had been stranded many years earlier on a desert island. When the man tasted albatross he realised that he had never tasted it before. This meant that the meat he had been given on the island was not albatross as he had been told.

This has something in common with The Arm of the Postal Service but is in my opinion even better. It is fiendishly difficult to figure out from a standing start. A beautiful aspect of this problem is the subtle fact that he shot himself because he did not r..."

If you’ve landed here voluntarily then my wish is that you’ll stay- for the food, I hope, but maybe also for the stories, the culture, the truths and the happenings that surround this one dish. Because that’s what food is about, isn't it? Once upon a time, before the loudness of Instagram reels and TikTok, before perfection, comparison and unattainable standards, before all of that, once upon a time it was just this one simple dish, and all the joy that it brought to our tables.I suppose I should start with how I got here, and an honest confession that a couple years ago, at the very height of my career, I fell out of love with food. Perhaps I should have seen it coming, or perhaps it was a deeply rooted feeling anyway. But recipes just became a deadline, cooking became..."
