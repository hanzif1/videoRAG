Here are some examples of what I mean: \"He rolled over on the bed\" vs \"He rolled over on his bed.\" Probably the second one, right? As long as it's his bed. On the contrary, something public like a bus stop bench will probably never be a \"his\" and will always be \"the\", but what about other things? A booth in a restaurant? A bar stool? Does any seat become \"his/her\" the moment someone sits in it, or does it depend on something? Read more Share New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities.
