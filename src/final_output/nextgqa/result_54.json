Her foster parents watched anxiously from behind. The man who claimed to be her biological father sat just a few feet away, his suit crisp, his expression calm—but something about him made the air feel heavier.

Slips and falls are a normal part of child development, as children are constantly running around and playing. Children are naturally inquisitive and like to jump around and climb various structures. While some falls may not be serious, many more are, resulting in broken bones, cuts or head injuries. Around nine children aged 3 - 4 years are hospitalised each week for a fall-related injury. Falls-related injuries are the number one cause of hospitalisation for babies and young children of this age. Falls from climbing on furniture, tumbling from an ope..."

If it was every once in awhile, it would probably be ok, but I find it very annoying when used over and over.For years the annoying word was ‘like.’ Remember the ‘Valley Girl’ talk? Not only was the word ‘like’ used a lot, there was a whole accent used as well.Now days, people are using-scratch that-people are OVERusing the word, right. Right?Like the word like, (oops) the word right is used as a filler word much like um, well um, and um, etc.The train of thought is that people use filler words because they’re insecure. Insecure in the subject matter they’re speaking about or insecu..."

What now? My little brown dog(12yo male, neutered, 15lbs) was cornered by the gate to exit the kitchen as my big black dog(1yo female, spayed, 70lbs) came up behind him excited. The brown is old and grumpy and turned and snapped a warning as usual, I believe this is where I messed up, I was rough housing with black dog just as brown dog snapped, cuz this time the black dog reacted and bit down and latched on with a “death shake.” I held black dog down with a choke hold to let go of brown dog, which eventually happened after what felt like the longest minute. Unfortunately there was damage, few open wounds requiring stitches. My concern is what happens now? Can the black dog be trusted not be so ..."

It is also an adult toy, in the sense that it helps to have a PhD in physics to figure out how it works. Besides, some adults DO play with spinning tops (check the web), and some make very elegant ones (see www.puccimanuli.com under spinners). A spinning top is remarkable because it tends to defy gravity while it is spinning. If spun fast enough, a spinning top will rise to a vertical position and happily stay there, despite the fact that it will fall over if it stops spinning. A spinning egg is just as amazing. If a hard-boiled egg is spun fast enough it will rise up and spin on one end. A tippe top does something similar, but is even more spectacular. It turns itself completely upside down and ends up spinning with its peg underneath the sphere that was originally spinning  underneath the peg used to spin it.   The basic physics behind all these effects is that a torq..."

The irony, of course, is that this simple pleasure may seem more elusive than ever before.

So I normally like to do a temperature check after 3 dates just to see if we are on the same page in terms of can we see this actually going somewhere. I went on 3 awesome dates (over about 3.5 weeks) with a lady, with the last one ending in a sleepover (no sex) and the first two dates being 8 hours long. Last night I told her I was not interested in pursuing things with anyone else and asked her where he head was at, to which she replied things are moving way too quickly for her and today she shut us down completely, saying we’re in different headspaces.

Read why one of our contributors chose this review here. There is a moment in Steven Spielberg‘s “The Color Purple” when a woman named Celie smiles and smiles and smiles. That was the moment when I knew this movie was going to be as good as it seemed, was going to keep the promise it made by daring to tell Celie’s story. It is not a story that would seem easily suited to the movies. Celie is a black woman who grows up in the rural South in the early decades of this century, in a world that surrounds her with cruelty.
