Take a look back at the story of THINK! and where it all began. The UK government has been running road safety campaigns for more than 75 years. The Central Office of Information (COI) ran the government’s road safety campaigns until 2000, when THINK! was officially established as the government’s designated road safety campaign. Since then, THINK! has become recognised internationally for its iconic and ground-breaking campaigns that have challenged dangerous behaviours on Britain’s roads. Our campaigns have evolved from encouraging the use of seat belts to tackling excessive speed, drink and drugs, and the use of mobiles at the wheel. In the decade that followed the conception of THINK!, road deaths in the UK reduced by 46%. 1926 The earliest record for road deaths show 4,886 people..."

These elusive big cats move with ghost-like stealth. Equipped with a beautiful spotted coat that doubles as camouflage and a suite of powerful adaptations, leopards have become one of the most successful wild cat species on the planet. Yet despite their prowess, this endangered species faces growing challenges from habitat loss to human conflict, relying on protected areas and sanctuaries to survive in many regions. Leopard behavior (independence, cunningness, adaptability, etc.) have allowed them to thrive in environments ranging from arid deserts to tropical jungles. While many wild cat species (like the small Asian leopard cat, fishing cat, or jungle cat) share similar instincts, the leopard’s combination of strength, agility, and patience sets it apart as a top predator. Even our domestic cats (Felis catus/cat felis) give ..."
