I played with the dogs my parents had, four different boxers, covering four decades of my life. I played with a couple of other dogs I lived with.

Teaching fetch can be a bit more challenging for some cats than it is for dogs. Fetch includes multiple skills — chasing the toy, picking it up, carrying it back to you, and dropping it into your hand. Some cats do one or two of these steps naturally, but others don't.

I started in 1991 with a quick snapshot, and I continued taking photographs with each departure. I never set out to make this series. I just took these photographs as a way to deal with the sadness of leaving. It gradually turned into our good-bye ritual.

Sometimes it’s a toddler who fell down the stairs after slipping past the baby gate. Sometimes it’s a small child who fell out of bed during a restless night’s sleep. And older kids can play a little too hard and take a spill, especially when they start running around a favorite kids’ spot like Como Regional Park in St. Paul or Hyland Play Area in Bloomington.
