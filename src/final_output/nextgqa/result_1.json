What is it like to Parent an Autistic Child? Posted Date : on Dec 8, 2023 Share : Print Being autistic brings both gifts and challenges. For example, we have often noticed that a dash of genius is within autism, manifesting as specific skills in mathematics or music or having perfect pitch or having a big compassionate heart and being an “animal whisperer.” We also know that our autistic community members have advanced every field of human endeavour from the arts to science to technology. There are musicians such as Mozart and Beethoven, artists such as van Gogh, activists such as Greta Thornburg, mathematicians such as Alan..."

I would argue that in many cases, screen time can actually be good for autistic children, and maybe we can let go of some of the fear, shame and parent blame around screens. My view is based on my lived experience as an autistic person myself, and a parent of two autistic children.What does ‘screen time’ actually mean anyway?When we break it down, the concept of ‘screen time’ can actually refer to a multitude of different activities. It’s easy to assume that screen time is a passive activity, such as watching TV. But it can also be creative, for example writing,..."

BridgeAugust 21, 2018 When it was time for cake at my second birthday party, I sat at a table surrounded by smiling grown-ups. One of the grown-ups asked me a question. I don’t remember the question itself, but I remember my answer: “Actually, it’s crooked.” Actually and crooked were two of my favorite words as a toddler. Whether or not it really answered the question, my reply made every adult in the room laugh. I felt a little embarrassed. My mom remembers people in the supermarket staring in surprise when they heard clear, complex sentences coming from a tiny child in a shoppi..."

Sometimes words, however descriptive (even mine!), can’t do them justice. So, I’ve attached a video from one of my classes to this post to visually demonstrate. Please have a look (no actors were hired). I was stunned to learn years ago that once a baby is able to sit securely on her own (usually 8 to 12 months old), she can actually sit down to eat at her own little table.  High chairs are certainly functional and have been around for hundreds of years, but believe it or not, it is easier to feed a baby at a small table.  And babies love the independence — their feet touch the floor, they can sit while hungry, and leave the table as soon..."

This behaviour is referred to as cat zoomies. But why do cats get zoomies, and are cat zoomies good for them? Let's find out... Cat Zoomies MeaningZoomies are also referred to as a frenetic random activity period or FRAP. During these sessions, your cat may frantically run around, pounce, bop, claw, climb, or excessively meow without any obvious cause. Zoomies in cats can happen at any time of day, and all ages and breeds may display this comical behaviour. Why Do Cats Get the Zoomies?Zoomies are caused when your cat experiences a build-up of excess energy. They can be a sign that your cat isn’t getting enough physical or mental stimulation. This is most common in indoor cats as they’re not able to be outside practicing their natural hunti..."

I BLACKWATER PARK, HAMPSHIRE. June 11th, 1850. — Six months to look back on — six long, lonely months since Laura and I last saw each other! How many days have I still to wait? Only one! To-morrow, the twelfth, the travellers return to England. I can hardly realise my own happiness — I can hardly believe that the next four-and-twenty hours will complete the last day of separation between Laura and me. She and her husband have been in Italy all the winter, and afterwards in the Tyrol. They come back, accompanied by Count Fosco and his wife, who propose to settle somewhere in the neighbourhood of London, and who have engaged to stay at Blackwater Park for the summer months before deciding on a place of residence.

My mother and sister had spoken so many last words, and had begged me to wait another five minutes so many times, that it was nearly midnight when the servant locked the garden-gate behind me. I walked forward a few paces on the shortest way back to London, then stopped and hesitated. The moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky, and the broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light to be hundreds of miles away from the great city that lay beneath it. The idea of descending any sooner than I could help into the heat and gloom of London repelled me. The prospect of going to bed in my airless chambers, and the prospect of gradual suffocation, seemed, in my present restless frame of mind and body, to be one and the same thing. I determined to st..."

If the machinery of the Law could be depended on to fathom every case of suspicion, and to conduct every process of inquiry, with moderate assistance only from the lubricating influences of oil of gold, the events which fill these pages might have claimed their share of the public attention in a Court of Justice.

Yayoi Kusama is a contemporary Japanese artist. She is famous for her immersive installations, sculptures, paintings, and performances. The artist is known for her obsession with polka dots. Kusama is now one of the most influential and respected artists in the world of art. Born in 1929 in Matsumoto, Japan, Kusama grew up in a conservative family that disapproved of her passion for art. She studied oil painting at the Kyoto School of Arts, but was quickly drawn to the artistic avant-garde of Tokyo. In 1957, she moved to New York. She then began to create her works influenced by the minimalist art movement and popular art. THE ARTISTIC STYLE OF YAYOI KUSAMA Kusama is k..."

Shortly after, in 1928, Disney introduced its cartoon darling Minnie Mouse wearing a red polka dot dress and matching bow. Throughout the 1930s, polka dot dresses appeared in stores, the fabric suddenly subversive, nipped in by ribbons and accentuated with bows. In 1940, the woozy melody of Frank Sinatra’s ballad “Polka Dots and Moonbeams” captured the height of America’s polka dot mania — that spring, the Los Angeles Times assured its readers, “You can sign your fashion life away on the polka-dotted line, and you’ll never regret it.”Later in the decade, the polka do..."

Just ask ultramarathon runner Dion Leonard. He went to the Gobi Desert in China in 2016 to win a grueling six-day, 155-mile race. He finished second among the world-elite runners but is still enjoying life’s victory lap thanks to lessons he continues to learn from the scrappy stray dog he adopted and named Gobi. They met and bonded at that Gobi Desert race. But Leonard’s attempts to adopt and bring her home proved to be time-consuming, challenging, and expensive. And then, somehow, during the Gobi’s required quarantine, ..."

Under an umbrella of iridescent clouds, Catherine Cournane makes her way toward the back plots. She meanders past the grave of her mother, two brothers and a cousin. She visits them often here in Cahersiveen’s Holy Cross Graveyard. But on this day, she is here for someone else. Baby John. It has been two days since Catherine last tended his grave and at the headstone, she sees fresh chrysanthemums. Their yellow and orange petals have weathered the pelting rain and wind. Catherine wonders who left them there. Other babies are buried at Holy Cross and their loved ones look after them. But Baby John has no one. So, Catherine took on the task of looking after the grave.

Posted on July 22, 2014 by Theo Stewart Roger Abrantes states here that researchers at the University of California in Santa Barbara confirmed that dogs see color, though not as well differentiated as humans do. Abrantes says that studies performed by Russian scientists demonstrated that dogs tend to discriminate real color rather than brightness cues. Very interesting then that Kong makes their toys mostly red! Why not blue? Is it because it’s the humans with money in our pockets and we are more likely to choose red?
