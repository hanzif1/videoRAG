I've been checking out various keychain models, and I'm impressed by their near negligible bulk, high lumen output, and low price. Think I'm going to add one to my carry! p.s.

Arduino controls the process. It features a custom made antenna large enough to function as a gate, which makes it easy for the animal to activate and quite reliable. Some methods and techniques are borrowed from my previous project, the RFID cat feeder. Whereas the feeder controls access to a food bowl, the door controls access to an entire room. The latest code can also distinguish between tags to allow the system to behave differently for different individuals.  RFID door (entering) from champenoise on Vimeo. How it works: 1.

And my choice of CAD is GH - reason I got the CNC in the first place. Long story short, I had no idea what i got into… But trying to do a pro job as possible, here are some pictures I made of this project so far. Started in March 2023. The commission is for a Lespaul (no year given - but not a hollow body) - And at first impossible to find a perfect 3D model that is based on reality - so I started with a simpler model where I found the right plans - 1950’s style plans! Glad I took Industrial design drafting 101 (35 years ago!) Anyway the program evolved and later added option to change the body, the neck, the head, fret scales and insets, etc etc etc… And all CNC friendly… The hardest part to do was the neck… 2023-03-31 17_08_25-Telecaster 1.0.3dm (6 MB) - Rhinoceros 7 Commercial1115×806 141 KB ..."

Members • Weird_Fishing_8859 If your cat has ever eaten string, elastic, laces, ribbon, etc., how long did it take to pass?? Sensitive/Seeking Support My cat ate about 4 inches of elastic that he chewed off of a mask and was told by the emergency vet to monitor for signs of distress, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain.

Is it common for them to pass in a week ..."

Discussion Posting this with great trepidation as I am not a bot (and I'm really hoping I have enough karma points after all the downvotes that I don't get kicked off Reddit). I think there are good parts of the With Love Meghan series. The episode with Roy Choi is in particularly good as the Korean sauces and cooking techniques are interesting as is his brining technique.

I just watched the film today, and I really enjoyed it. Ignoring the obvious arguments about the violence, and Tarantino in general, I was wondering about Zoe Bell's character. She's only credited as one of the slave trackers, but there was an odd amount of focus placed on her character in relation her actual acting, plus she was heavily stylized.

Never thought anything of it until recently and saw another kid of similar age with much more relaxed arms when lying on back. She is otherwise hitting all milestones on time or ahead of schedule.
