This is one dark and often grim work. Recommendation This was another Disney production (well, co-production here) in the early 80s when the company was experimenting with more adult and mature films (see also the duo of \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" and \"Watcher in the Woods), most of which didn't do so well on release. But this one, this went further than most. This was before the PG-13 rating was created, so some parents saw a PG-rated fantasy with the Dis..."

Members • vethe2 iPod click wheel touch respond when screen is off. What annoys me about the iPod Classic is that the click wheel still responds to touch even when the screen is off. Sometimes, I accidentally touch it, and it increases or decreases the volume of the song I'm listening to. It's really frustrating. I know there's a Hold button to disable the click wheel, but I don't want to have to toggle that button every time I put the device down. Am I the only one experiencing this, or is this a default feature of the iPod? If it's a feature, is there a way to turn it off? I sold my iPod and bought a Fiio M3K, which works perfectly.

The game I'm referring to has the following rules: Anywhere from 3 to 10+ kids line up against a brick wall. Then, 1 or more kids throw balls at the kids on the wall.

If you were on the wall, you had to keep your feet within a foot or so of the wall. Your goal when you were on the wall was to avoid being hit, because if you got hit, there was a good chance the ball would hit your skull, and then your skull would smash against the brick wall. Whoever was left would get to throw next. Teachers hated it for obvious reasons. The reason I'm asking ..."

They’re smaller, I like to make my kids feel special, and quite frankly their rooms are way more fun to do! I always use a fresh coat of paint because it’s the cheapest, easiest way to freshen up a room. Wallpaper is scary to me, thanks to a traumatizing summer nearly 20 years ago that I spent steaming and scraping seven layers of wallpaper off of my old bedroom – including the ceilings. But I’m cool with any design I can paint on the walls because it’s easy to paint back over them if they become dated. If you’re looking for some funky geometric designs to..."

I HATE IT. To me it’s making it about the kid when it’s clearly not, teaches a child to be spoiled and think everything is about them, this year my baby cousin (3) stuck her dirty fingers into my cake and blew out my candles. I know this is a stupid reason to be upset but I absolutely hate it. I was raised to think of it as rude and I still think it is. Total pet peeve Read more S..."

It's not my best video but should be enough to learn from. Put a collar on him so you have something to hold and stop him pulling away. Then, when he has a ball, put all your fingers around the ball so your fingers are in his mouth. Then just hold but put pressure on his lips. 'Don't pull' Wait.., pulling causes him to pull back. Hold his collar still so he cannot pull you. He should let go because dogs automatically open their mouth when they feel their lips on their own teeth. My Aunt June taught me that when cleaning teeth or giving a tablet to dogs. They cannot bite you because they will bite their own lips so they open their mouth. I then used it to extract rabbits from Jack Russells that didn't want to give them up. Or when a Jack Russells didn't want to let go of another Jack Russel. Quarrelsome beasts Jack Russels.

Factual Questions exvex September 9, 2003, 7:00pm 1 I’ve coming across more and more casual photos lately featuring individuals posing while giving the middle finger. For example someone I know showed me photos she had of friends from her high school and in at least a third of the photos the person is posing for the picture while flashing the upraised middle finger. Why would you do this and what does it mean? I understand something like making devil’s horns behind another person’s head in a photo. That’s not terribly clever but I understand it. But smiling politely and flipping off the photographer? I’ve always assumed the middle finger was a “Screw You” gesture reserved for hostile situations, such as being cut off in traffic and such. Is there any etiquette for when/when not..."

These points are often used by professionals as well as beginners and are key elements in building a dynamic pose. So I hope you guys have some good level of understanding in anatomy so that you can apply these points when drawing dynamic poses. Avoiding symmetry: When you're drawing a dynamic pose especially in any kind of scenario it's better to avoid symmetry because symmetry not only makes the pose a bit boring but also there is not much flow so it also makes the overall pose stiff. When you avoid symmetry in your drawing poses you can create a more interesting and engaging artwork. It adds a sense of movement and energy which are essential i..."

Support Animation and Rigging characters Pewi73 (Pewi73) April 3, 2019, 10:34am 1 I’m wondering about something. Is it something I have missed or is it just a feature missing. I have a rigged character with poses in the pose library. For example when selecting the finger joints and adding a pointing pose to the fingers, I would like to have the new pose to be added gradually, say with a spinner value. Not just an absolute button (the little “Apply specified Pose Library pose to the rig.” button). I would like to make the pose keyed in between two poses for greater flexibility. Is there any way to achieve this? Using a scirpt or add-on? Is my question clear to anyone?

When to be concerned about your child’s falling As you watch your little one walking or running during play, you may ask yourself, “Is my child falling too much?” Children initially begin to walk between the ages of 12 and 15 months. In the early stages of walking, you may notice your child “waddling” with their feet wide and their arms out like an airplane.

Climbing trees is an instinctual behavior crucial for their survival. This is especially true for panda cubs born in the wild. When female pandas venture out to forage for bamboo, their cubs, left without protection, become vulnerable to predators. The cubs will climb trees to evade these threats. Additionally, resting on tree branches allows them to bask in the sunlight, which is essential for their healthy growth and development. | iPanda"

For example I was taking a shower and couldn't reaxh my feet so I put my foot on a small stool and bended forward a bit, I instantly felt somw presure in my belly, like a balloon that is being... Well... Squished. So this random thought crossed my mind, did I accudentally squished/harmed the baby? Now I'm 17w and I don't know how to put my shoes on, wash my feet, cut my toenails, put my panties on, etc without bending. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and ..."

Most fetuses will turn to a head-first position by 36 weeks. Your provider may try to turn the fetus if it doesn’t turn on its own. A vaginal breech birth can be dangerous, so most providers recommend a C-section delivery when your baby remains breech.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Throwaway account b/c I didn't want to use my personal one but... met a guy and he's 6'4 but I'm 5'1 and of course I adore the size difference but I don't know if he does. I'm feeling insecure about it all and don't know if I should pursue anything with him because of it. I mean I always hear about how much it fucking sucks for tall guy's backs when they have to bend down just to talk in a loud place and/or kiss, etc. Not to mention if this thing turned into a serious, long-term thing that sex would be awkward. tl;dr: Can you tall guys just te..."

But the technique has been around for a long time. The first paper I found describing implicit functions and performing boolean operations by combining them with the min() and max() operators is from 1972 by A.Ricci and by B.Wyvill and G.Wyvill in 1989. The first mention of raymarched SDFs that I've been able to find is also from this time - the paper by Sandin, Hart and Kauffman, which used it for rendering 3D fractals. Seven years later in 1995 C.Hart himself documented the raymarching technique again, but unfortunately miscalled it \"Sphere Tracing\" (the raymarcher traces only rays when point sampling and cones when filtering, but definitely not spheres). So I think it's fair to say raymarching of SDFs has been an o..."
