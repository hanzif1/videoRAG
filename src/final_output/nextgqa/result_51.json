The Manx Crosses are a group of 210 cross slabs carved of local slate on the Isle of Man from the late 5th century through the early 13th. The earliest examples were Celtic Christian high crosses. After the Norse conquest in the 9th century, the Viking population melded their tradition of carved slabs inscribed with runes and intricate designs of animals, people and deities with the Celtic crosses. Manx National Heritage has scanned and digitized the Manx Crosses and ma..."

Members • Ploymish88 Baby arms constantly up in air- is this normal? Skills and Milestones Is it normal for baby arms to always be raised in the air when they’re on their back? It’s not like startle reflux where their hands shoot up- it’s their normal state. Just when awake, laying on back with hands out in front of them raised and/or flailing around like they’re reaching for something. Been doing this pretty much since born and now 10 weeks.

What were your feelings when you first watched this bit on the show? What did you think about the fact that none of them could figure it out? Let me know your thoughts.

Members • Public_Party 中文 (繁體) How to handle when little kids admit they stole from my store? I have a coffee/ice cream shop, but I also have lots of candy. I'm sure I'm being stolen from all the time even with cameras, but I never know what to say when a parent marches their child back into the store to admit they stole some candy. I obviously don't want to say \"It's okay,\" but I honestly don't know the most impactful thing to say without being an a-hole. Today I said something like \"when you steal from someone, everyone gets hurt,\" or something like that. Any ideas what you'd like a shopkeeper to say to your child in a similar situation?

It is called “cross identification.” It identifies itself with its mother in this “give and take” relationship. It is the notion of “mutuality.” She realizes that Mother does something for her, that she gives her something (milk, security, warmth, comfort, etc...) and then the baby has the desire to give something to their mother too. She is saying “Thank you, I love you.” Sometimes, I am not in a place to have fingers up my nose.. and other times, I try to pause and accept the gratitude and “mutuality” at play. Did you already know this? How do you feel when your child does this? Isn’t it astounding, the amount of communication and connection at play even at a young age? 👶🏼🧠🫀🥹 | Fox Meets Bear"

I send the end effector to (X0, Y5, Z2.8) and it will arc back down and retrace the initial line, and extend the line off to the right, ending on the paper.
