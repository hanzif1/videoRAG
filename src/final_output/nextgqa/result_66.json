This imagery is often used to convey the divine intervention of God in the affairs of humanity, whether in acts of judgment against the wicked or in deliverance and protection for His people.Divine JudgmentOne of the primary contexts in which \"the hand stretched out\" is used is in the context of divine judgment. In the book of Isaiah, this phrase is repeatedly employed to describe God's impending judgment on nations and peoples who have turned away from His commandments. Isaiah 5:25 states, \"Therefore the anger of the LORD burns against His people; His hand is raised against them to strike them down. The mountains quake, and their corpses lie like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this..."

He mentions that his people struggled with Isaiah precisely because they did not know this manner of prophecy.1This is a problem that persists for many people today.One common idiom found in Nephi’s quotation of Isaiah is a great example of something that is better understood when the ancient Israelite cultural background is brought into the picture. It is the phrase, “For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still” (see 2 Nephi 15:25; 19:12, 17, 21; 20:4).  ..."

Answer In Isaiah 9:8—10:4, the prophet warns of God’s impending judgment on the northern kingdom of Israel. Despite repeated calls for repentance and severe punishment, the northern kingdom persisted in idolatry and pride. Therefore, God’s anger had not diminished: “The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger has not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still” (Isaiah 9:12, ESV). This key refrain, “his..."

What if the members only guy was just a relative of one of Tony's victims who just happened to run into him at the diner? Because think about it, if it was a planned hit, the \"hitman\" was pretty clumsy. For one thing he walked in front of AJ and made himself visible to Tony, not to mention he sat like right next to Tony and kept looking at him, that would've easily raised suspicion but luckily for him it didn't.

Cafe Society Rhythmdvl March 12, 2014, 11:12am 1 We take in an absurd amount of live music. At most shows, some (all) speakers have a mic mounted right up against the grille. That’s terribly counter-intuitive–the speakers are being driven by cabling coming through the sound board, so wouldn’t they have a clean signal already? My best guess is that these are stage monitors and the mics are pushed up against them to eliminate feedback, but that’s grasping at Marshalls. Anyone? Crotalus March 12, 2014, 12:05pm 2 Your basic assumption, that the speakers you see with mics are driven by signals from the sound board, is incorrect.

I drove a few miles down an empty forest service road and arrived at the TH with no other cars except for 1 car that was very clearly stolen and trashed and recently marked for towing by Rangers. This was my first time hiking this trail and it was very seldom hiked in the winter with the last activity on all trails being > 2 weeks ago. Also, the trail led straight into a protected wilderness area with no other intersecting trails. I realized I might be the only person out there all day and would be the only person for miles. For whatever reason, I got a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Idk if..."

Members • myheadsintheclouds Русский I feel horrible, my baby rolled off the couch and landed on her stomach. My 3 month old was on the couch and I was in the same room, I was grabbing something a few feet away when I heard a thump and crying. She was on her belly.

She can’t roll back to belly on the floor, only on the couch because it’s super plush. She cried for a minute w..."

As a child, Hoop was fascinated with playing basketball but suffered an injury that set him back with his life plans. The film, after this intro, then cuts to Hoop as a grown man, and plays out this way in an almost Moonlight–like manner.

Is This Normal?By Jaime MilanUpdatedApr. 30, 2025Photo by Chewy Studios, grumpy_kitzia/InstagramQ: My cat randomly makes the weirdest face after smelling something. Their mouth just hangs open and they look super confused! Is this normal?A: When a cat keeps their mouth open after smelling something—almost as if they’re making a “stinkface”—they’re exhibiting something called the flehmen response. This odd behavior is, in fact, normal (even a little funny to watch!), and it actually helps them to smell whatever it is they’re smelling. What Does the Flehmen Response Look Like?The flehmen response gets its name from the German word flehmen, which means “to curl the upper lip.” In addition to curling back their upper lip, a cat may curl their tongue, or show their front teeth, while others simply look perplexed or disgusted.

I don’t know about you, but I smell with my nose. But does your cat ever appear to be smelling something with her mouth? I bet you’ve seen this before: your cat is catching a scent the usual way, with his nose, when he suddenly seems to go into a kind of trance. Maybe he curls his lips, and wrinkles his little nose. He might leave his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, and make a huffing sound, like he’s sucking in air. It almost appears as if your cat is disgusted by whatever she’s sm..."
