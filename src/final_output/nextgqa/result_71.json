To determine the probability of the given events, we need to know the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. a) To find the probability of $$x=2$$x=2, we need to determine the number of outcomes where $$x=2$$x=2. Since $$n=4$$n=4 and $$\\pi=0.60$$π=0.60, we can use the binomial probability formula: $$P(x=k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot \\pi^k \\cdot (1-\\pi)^{n-k}$$P(x=k)=(kn​)⋅πk⋅(1−π)n−k. Plugging in the values, we get $$P(x=2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot 0.60^2 \\cdot (1-0.60)^{4-2}$$P(x=2)=(24​)⋅0.602⋅(1−0.60)4−2.

Discussion I've read/heard many people (and I used to think this too) say that the lyrics should be \"til someone's on their knee [as in a singular knee] and asks you\" because obviously, when someone proposes they are on one knee. But, as we all know, Miss Swift always writes her lyrics with a purpose. The lyrics \"sometimes you just don't know the answer til someone's on their knees and asks you\" can be interpreted differently. I think that the \"someone\" here is meant to be ambiguous - \"someone\" could be the guy who is proposing, or it ..."

The answer should be very simple. They are joints that allow our legs to bend so that we can walk.But the answer is not so simple when we consider some of the cultural connotations of the word \"knee.\"When George McCartney (1737-1806), the first British envoy to China, was ordered to fall to his knees before Chinese Emperor Qian Long (1711-99) in 1793, the joints had more significance than merely as parts of the body.The sculptures of an ancient couple - Qin Hui and his wife - on display at an art gallery in Shanghai late last month have touched off a debate.

My husband is my best friend, a very loyal, honest and loving man before addiction took hold. My husband was practically teetotal before trying cocaine once when he was 30, given to him by a good friend on a day to watch the football. He soon became hooked but this was kept a secret from me for 4 years. He would use when me and my children were asleep in bed. All unknown to us. His behaviour changed massively over this time, paranoia, moodiness and generally being off with us and everyone e..."

So, naturally, I have a question (well, actually, a million of them). My 5 1/2 month old is doing a (weird?) thing. He started pushing up a little bit when he was about 3 months old. He got pretty good at it…while he never pushed up so that his arms were fully extended, he could get his chest off the floor. When he was 4 1/2 months old he started rolling over (from his back to his stomach). Now when he’s on his stomach, though, he extends his arms backwards (like he’s flying). He can still lift his chest off the floor when he does this (and his legs, too…he balances on his stomach). If I move his arms up for him to support himself, he moves them right..."

We try to feed my 2.5 year old things he likes and aren’t too picky about what he eats. The only thing we try to focus on is non processed food at least 4 nights a week (so we’d make chicken nuggets instead of frozen, Mac and cheese from scratch instead of the box.

Below are some normal behaviors for children aged 12 months to 36 months (3 years) of age. Refusing to eatFood refusal during this phase is not personal, and it does not mean that your toddler does not like the food they rejected.

The toddler brain is wired to learn by pushing boundaries, saying, “No,” and exploring the reactions to their “no’s.” This is normal and does not mean your toddler has regressed.

They determine what they prefer or what they do not prefer in many areas of their daily life. In regards to mealtime experiences, children learn what their mouth likes and what their mouth dislikes. Parents help support their child’s autonomy by adhering to their child’s wishes, however, we also want children to continue learning about new foods as they grow.

For the sake of fairness, I must note that the idea of ​​this essay did not come to me immediately. But rather during the process of analyzing the movements of the best World Cup skiers as well as a large number of You Tube demos.

Do you expect your child to do housework, contribute to groceries and bills, and pay rent while he stays with you? How long are you willing to let him live in your ..."

Our doubts shout at us: Was it something I did? Would this have happened if I’d been a better parent? Would this have happened if I had been more spiritual, or if we had prayed more as a family? Would this have happened if my marriage hadn’t failed? Would this have happened if we hadn’t argued so much? The what-ifs can paralyze our souls and wreak havoc on our confidence as parents. One of the greatest heartbreaks for a parent is watching a child waste his or her life, potential, or opportunities with poor choices. One woman said to me, “I’ve been through a lot of pain in my life, but I..."

After looking through a loose-leaf binder with photographs of cakes taped onto the pages, she ordered chocolate, the child's favorite. The cake she chose was decorated with a spaceship and launching pad under a sprinkling of white stars, and a planet made of red frosting at the other end. His name, SCOTTY, would be in green letters beneath the planet. The baker, who was an older man with a thick neck, listened without saying anything when she told him the child would be eight years old next Monday. The baker wore a white apron that looked like a smock. Straps cut under his arms, went around in back and then to the front again, where they were secured under his heavy waist. He wiped his hands on his apron as he listened to her. He kept his eyes down on the photographs and let her talk. He let her take her time. H..."

Okay, so while a lot of things are left unanswered in the series or left for speculation by the end of the show, the thing that has bothered me the most is that there has never been a definitive answer as to who the Old Lady is in relation to Zorome. When I first watched episode ten, let me tell you, the thought she could be his mom was not something that had entered my mind...not until I looked at theories and the wiki. I often wonder why this isn't touched on more because it may be one of the biggest mysteries left for us to speculate on. I do not think it's possible for her to be his mother.

No, not just by my Mom, although she has also said so. The thing about hugs, is that most folks don’t think about it. They just come in and squeeze. Sometimes too hard, sometimes too soft, sometimes just right.

I love what the Free Hugs people do when they stand in a city centre holding a ‘Free Hugs’ sign. Their hugs produce human connection, vulnerability, smiles, laughter, positive emotion, and even sometimes tears, especially if it’s the first hug a person who has been suffering has experienced in a long while. Hugs are also good for the heart. They increase our levels of the hormone ‘oxytocin’, which as well as being known for its role in trust, childbirth, and breastfeeding, is also a powerful ‘cardioprotective’ hormone. This basically means it helps protect the cardiovascular system. From what? You might ask. From the negative side-effects of poor dietary and lifestyle choices and ..."
