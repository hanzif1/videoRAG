This is something that I have been obsessively trying to figure out; how does a surfboard turn? I mean from my experience, it’s leaning and “pivoting” off your back foot, which results in going up the face, but in my mind, I don’t see any rotation. Yes, you rotate your shoulders and your hips, which I guess is how it turns, but you can still perform basic carving and trimming turns without significant upper body rotation. To me, it just doesn’t connect with how a board turns in the water, as there is no rudder on a surfboard. To finally get rid of th..."

Keeping Warm: Built-In Thermoregulation Birds lose a lot of body heat through their bare legs and feet, especially in cooler conditions. By tucking one leg up into their feathers, they reduce the amount of exposed skin, minimizing heat loss. This is why you’ll often see birds standing on one leg on a chilly mornin..."

Share: A young Cooper’s Hawk standing on one foot. Birds will often stand on one foot to minimize heat loss. Some birds with fleshy feet, such as doves, have relatively short legs and can hunker down so their warm belly is pressed against their feet while perched, but accipiters, such as this young Cooper’s Hawk, have longer legs that make this far more difficult.

I have a very large, very close group of friends that I have been friends with for nearly a decade. When I met my ex, he didn’t really have any friends of his own but made a few friends in my group and was friendly with just about everyone.

No reservation, just a hopeful walk-in. They’ve tucked you into a cramped corner of a restaurant known only for serving wine, which you accept without a hesitation. It’s one of those nights: a candle flickers on the wooden table, the lights dimmed to a warm, reddish hue. Somewhere in the background jazz with muted trumpets is giving the servers their rhythm as they pass through aisles and dance around tables. The walls are lined with framed photos of who-knows-what.

He walks the streets and alleys and hidden lanes of his neighbourhood. He does not see another living soul. Once there were children on bikes, shrieks from lemonade stands, messages of hope and love and hopscotch codes chalked on sidewalks, the splintered rip of hockey sticks on pavement. He is young, but even he can recall, vaguely, these sights and sounds. No more. The world sprawled out before him is carved into rigid plots and miniature fortresses, a maze of concrete, steel fences, manufactured siding and faded asphalt shingles. He walks slowly, but with purpose, his burden slung over his shoulder. He thinks he might be the last paperboy on earth. He has never ..."

I’ve heard this story a couple times from my uncle and mom, (who was probably trying to allude to the fact that I should get a job myself). The number of paper boys has declined rapidly in recent years. This is primarily due to the disappearance of afternoon newspapers, whose delivery times were suitable for young boys who would just get out of class. Morning papers were typically delivered before 6am and so they were managed by older men who made careers out of it. The number of paper boys has reduced dramatically as a result of the int..."
