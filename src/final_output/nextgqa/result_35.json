We spend our personal and professional lives gathering with others. “And we spend much of that time in uninspiring, underwhelming moments that fail to capture us, change us in any way, or connect us to one another,” Priya Parker writes in The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters. “Gathering—the conscious bringing together of people for a reason—shapes the way we think, feel, and make sense of our world,” she writes. “And yet most of us spend very little time thinking about the actual ways we gather.” This reality has implications for all aspects of our life.
