It’s recommended without second thought. Teachers do it every day. The idea is that it’s more effective and the student is more likely to heed your advice. Except, it isn’t true. Furthermore, it’s a mistake that you may long regret. Here’s why: It’s dangerous. SCM is a vessel for teacher horror stories. We hear it all, from teachers being accused of false crimes to their cars getting keyed in the parking lot. One of the most common reports is being punched and kicked by students.

Scientists have observed that these movements can change in response to the environment (darkness vs light), (water vs air), and if there is resistance placed to the arms the baby will counteract the resistance. This tells us that the movements are not all random. Babies are learning when they are moving their arms around: learning about motor- visual- spacial coordination even from birth. When babies are on their moms chest, and there is pressure/ resistance on their arms they push up (counter the resistance). This facilitates feeding at the breast as it helps them lift their head and smell the breast (movement also shown to be facilitated by odour and the smell of moms milk), and they can move to the breast. Your baby’s arms waving around are helping them learn. ❤️. If you are frustrated by “arms getting in the way” of latching, move the..."

He is still when feeding and sleeping but before a feed he moves with huge amounts of energy. He doesn't look like he's in pain, more a playful look. Unfortunately I've been reading comments via Google search and some people have suggested that this is linked to brain injury or autism. Can someone confirm if they're little one does the same.

Wolf and Curt Merrill, CNN Published March 5, 2025 Americans are reeling from the early weeks of Trump 2.0, and President Donald Trump got a prime-time chance to explain the fast and furious start to his return to power in an address to a joint session of Congress. He made the case for the trade wars he’s started with Canada and Mexico, defended his effort with Elon Musk to downsize and remake American government, and faced loud opposition and heckling from Democrats, one of whom was removed from the chamber.

Most people simply enjoy Foster's antics throughout, when they should be focusing on how his situation contrasts with Detective Prendergast's. You have two people who are under a considerable amount of stress throughout the whole movie. Foster simply can't adapt to this stress. The things that make him upset get to him so much that he explodes with anger. Prendergast, however, can adapt to the day-to-day stress really well - maybe even too well. Look at the dynamics between Foster and his ex-wife and Prendergast and his wife. Foster's ex-wife is fearful of him for good reason.

BLACK DOG APPEARS AND DISAPPEARS. IT WAS not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands; and were kept busy enough, without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest. It was one January morning, very early — a pinching, frosty morning — the cove all gray with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual, and set out down the beach, his..."

He carried his brass telescope under his arm, and he had his hat tilted back on his head. The old man’s breath hung in the air like smoke. Mother was helping my sick father upstairs, and I was setting the table for the captain’s breakfast when the door opened and a pale, greasy-looking creature walked in. He was missing two fingers from his left hand and he wore a cutlass too, but he didn’t look like a seafaring man. \"May I help you, sir?\" I asked. \"I’ll have some rum,\" he said. \"Are you setting that table for my mate Bill?\" \"It’s for the captain,\" I said. \"Well,\" he said, \"I expect Bill might like to be called ‘captain.’ Does your..."

As the sun rose, there was a stillness in the air. A distant crow’s call echoed across the water, breaking the silence. A man and a little boy walked out to the pond together.  The man reached down and picked up a small stone and threw it into the water. Kerplop. The splash stilled the crow’s call and caused rings to spread outward across the pond’s surface. Then the water stilled again.  The father picked up a second stone and threw it into the water. Kersplash. Once again, rings moved outward until the water once again became glass. The boy looked at his father with a quizzical look. “What are you doi..."

It’s flat and aerodynamic, and the shape promises a smooth skip across the slick surface of the water. The boy has sifted past a hundred other rocks. Perhaps a thousand. And finally–– finally, he has found one with just the right angles and leading edges. It’s a rock that shouldn’t exist. Not here anyways. It is a natural perfection that must’ve lost its way and wound up in this boy’s world. Imagine the whoop, the excited disbelief, and the hesitation to throw. It’s a shame to throw away such a rock, and it’s also a big responsibility. A skipping stone such as this will come into a boy's hands once, or maybe twice, ever. He knows this, and he is desperate not to blow his chance. A brief horror crosses the boy’s face as he considers the possibility of a plunk, a misfire, or a two-skip dud. He considers not throwing it at all; he co..."

He will sit up if I have my legs on both sides of him, and if I let go he sits own his own for a few seconds but then topples over.

When he thought back he could remember that Karl and Martin were two of his three best friends for life, but try as he might he couldn't remember who the other one was. And then something happened that meant that for two days he could leave Out-With and return to his old house: Grandmother had died and the family had to go home for the funeral. While he was there, Bruno realized he wasn't quite as small as he had been when he left because he could see over things that he couldn't see over before, and when they stayed in their old house he could look through the window on the top floor and see across Berlin without having to stand on tiptoes.

Had it not been for the fact that it would be the last chance for him and Shmuel to spend any time together - not to mention the fact that the adventure would be a very exciting one, especially since it involved dressing up - he would have given up on it for the day and waited until some afternoon the following week, when he didn't have anything special planned. However, the clock was ticking and there was nothing he could do about it. And after all, it was only the morning and a lot could happen between then and the late afternoon, which was when the two boys always met. The rain would surely have stopped by then.

Question Hi All, I'd like to start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the film, the music, and the overall experience of this movie.

In fact, it has been suggested that body language makes up 55% of communication, with the other 45% consisting of tone and words.While many nonverbal cues can be interpreted the same way regardless of gender, men often stand, gesture, and use their eyes in specific ways. A man’s body language can provide additional insights into his attitude and feelings that may not be conveyed by his words.

I've always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking. I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.

Like—a lot. Worse, every two weeks, he will then be subjected to a multiverse of afterlives: absurd, funny, brutal, depressing, wild, creepy, heart-wrenching afterlives. Some will be based on existing theories, some on my own demented imaginings. In each, Frank will begin anew, searching, as always, for his lost family in the messy business of the many potential Great Beyonds. Frank (thankfully) does not remember his past-afterlives. Yet, attentive readers who pick up clues along the way will be able to solve the mystery of what happened before Frank died. Frank died. Children sang. It was soft at first, a trickle ..."

I’ve competed and coached it at the collegiate level for about a decade, with a focus on recruiting and retaining guys. I’m still new to Substack and unsure of what to put here, so I was happy to see Cartoons Hate Her writing about why she believes men stopped dancing. Convincing young men that dance is worth learning is a passion I’ve honed over years of ballroom competition and teaching, so I have a lot to say. I agree with her that men have become more dance-shy, especially whites. They face social and cultural barriers that discourage them from enjoying it freely or learning it as a hobby.

But every spring a mighty wind blew a garlick-y, pepper-y smell through the streets and people remembered.  They remembered how she gathered the roots of the campanula rapunculus growing wild in her garden and boiled them into a lumpy stew as her nineteen cats circled the rough pot.

I have read entire books on dating and relationships and everyone always talks about how you should make eye contact and if someone holds eye contact or smiles that's an indication they might be open to talking to you.
