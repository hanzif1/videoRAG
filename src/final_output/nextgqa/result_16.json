They certainly don't seem that interesting to us. But Fido sees things differently. Whether it's digging them up, gathering them, hiding them, or chewing on them, rocks provide endless hours of entertainment for our dogs. What in the world is the appeal?

If you do not have experience reading transliteration please see the Guide to Transliteration. ☰ Lighting Candles At the beginning of Shabbat, candles are lit by the woman of the household (if there are no females over 12 years old present, a man may do this). They are lit before Shabbat begins, at least 18 minutes before sunset. She lights two candles, passes her hands over the candles a few times, then covers her eyes and recites this blessing. After the blessing is complete, she uncovers her eyes and looks at the lit candles as if for the first time. What is the reason for this odd procedure? Normally, blessings are recited before you do the thing that yo..."

My daughter is celebrating bat mitzvah this weekend (Reform congregation) and our family of four will be light the Shabbat candles on the bimah tonight. This is not something we ordinarily do, thus my question: Should all four of us cover our eyes after lighting the candles? Or just me as the mother? Or me and my older daughter who at 17 would be considered a Jewish adult?

This is my first post here after lurking for a while. My 9 month old son, when excited or very upset, will rotate his wrists (+/- ankles) around repetitively and sometimes flaps his arms. He doesn’t do it at all when he’s relaxing, occupied or playing. We went out to eat as a family tonight and when the waitress came to check on our table while we were feeding our son some mashed potatoes, she leaned down and said to us “my son used to make exactly the same hand movements, he was dia..."

                "detail": "Ever notice how your newborn baby waves their arms around? Why do they do that? Newborn arm movement is erratic, thought to be somewhat involuntary. Scientists have observed that these movements can change in response to the environment (darkness vs light), (water vs air), and if there is resistance placed to the arms the baby will counteract the resistance. This tells us that the movements are not all random. Babies are learning when they are moving their arms around: learning about motor- visual- spacial coordination even from birth. When babies are on their moms chest, and there is pressure/ resistance on their arms they push up (counter the resistance). This facilitates feeding at the breast as it helps them lift their head and smell the breast (movement also shown to be facilitated by odour and the smell of moms milk), and they can move to the breast. Your baby’s arms waving around are helping them learn. ❤️. If you are frustrated by “arms getting in the way” of latching, move the..."

If you have a campout, a work party, a family reunion, or any get-together with friends, youâ€™ve got to play it. It's kind of like musical chairs, but you're not moving around, and there are no chairs. Instead, you're going to use cups, or you can use spoons. First, gather your players. If you have 15 people, you need 14 cups. Lay them all out, and then give prompts like: ðŸŒ€ Touch your head. ðŸŒ€ Wiggle your fingers. ðŸŒ€ Touch your elbows. ðŸŒ€ Touch your eyes. When you say \"cup,\" everybody has to dive and try to grab a cup. One person will not get a cup, meaning they're out. Remove a cup as well. Each round, you lose a player and a cup, whittling down until you have two people left and one cup. It's so fun to watch people and their competitiveness. It was a blast! You've got to try it. This cup game was ridiculously fun to watch! At your next get-together, you have got to play it! Save this post for la..."

Advice Needed So my son is 6mo, and for the past 2 weeks we’ve really been struggling with diaper changes because he is SO determined to grab hold of all of his bits and pieces and squeeze (and also tug a little but not as much as squeeze). I’ve tried all of the tricks I’ve been given including giving him a toy, blocking his hands, covering his bits up with something, and the onesie snaps over the shoulder to keep the hands in. Nothing is working! He isn’t in any pain down there, and it also doesn’t seem to be hurting him when he does this - but it makes diaper changes ..."

Members Online • miawaww 中文 (繁體) Why is my bird standing on one leg? Joy has been standing on one leg for the past few days. I know I cut one of her nails too short about a week ago (didn’t bleed like crazy but I could see the blood coagulating on top), not sure if it still hurts. On the other paw, she still complained I was cutting them but I don’t think I hurt her. As soon as it happened, she was choosing one leg to stand on all the time (because I hurt her!); now it’s much less but still frequent. I think she would be on one foot sometimes in the past but I haven’t noticed the frequency (now I do). She also stands on one leg when she’s leaning ag..."

Members Online • newyorkamz24 Is consistent standing on one leg something to be worried about? Hi everyone, I have a 1 year old love bird and ever since he got his beak and toe nails trimmed, he seems to be standing on one foot quite often. I know they do this when they are tired, but he's been doing it throughout the day and even when I pick up him on my finger. Is this something to be worried about? I know they usually puff up when they are ill, he seems fine otherwise, is flying around and eating as usual, but the foot thing ..."

From doing a little research it seems that this is done mostly on college campuses during orientation. It was designed to provide college students an opportunity to understand and explore the ways that privilege (or lack of) can help people recognize the obstacles and benefits of privilege.

The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them. Who invented the microphone? The answer's not simple. Nor is it pretty. In 1877 Emile Berliner filed a patent for a microphone — the carbon microphone. Alexander Bell, who only a year before had invented the telephone, recognized the practical importance of Berliner's technology. So he bought the patent for $50 thousand — a huge sum at the time.

Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine. As for the roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses are the only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only flowers that everybody is certain of knowing.

Discussion Back when I was 12 years old, I saw 'The Ring' with some other teens. Interestingly, I'd seen 'Ringu' before it, and while it really scared me, nothing prepared me for this one scene in the American Remake. It's that scene early on in the movie where some lady talks about her daughter and says 'I saw her face', and it cuts to her daughter in a closet, all deformed due to The Ring girl. I'm 30 years old in 2 months, and I still wake up from time to time with anxiety, picturing that scene. Anyone else i..."

Like, every time I open the fridge door I have to physically block her from getting in, and she’s so fast and sneaky about it she often slips in anyway. She would happily sit there forever but I obviously can’t leave the door open for her to chill out in there - why is she doing this?!

It would be highly unlikely if a domestic cat likes to jump into the fridge to keep cool or to cool down if the room temperature is about 70°F (around 21°C). It is possible if the cat is overheating for a reason; perhaps because he has a mild fever. I am speculating but there are far more likely reasons. The 3 rea..."

There were times our cat didn't make it home before lights out and got stuck outside for the night. Being in the rural area, a cat door was not a solution either. So, we decided to build him a cat house for him to hang out in and give him some shelter. With the weather we had this year, this was one of the better projects we built. Step 1: Building Box Since our cat does not like small spaces, we had to build it large. Using several 2x2s to frame the box added the extra support needed to withstand our dogs using the roof as a lookout point. Our cat house ended up 18\" by 26\" by 18\" tall. Any size would do according to your cat's preference. We used exterior plywood left over from other projects and sealed the wood with waterproof paint. The roof/lid was attach..."
