As the crippled jet slid to a stop, the doors opened, the slides deployed, and passengers ran for their lives — but for many, the evacuation was over before it even began. In the back of the plane, the fire ripped into the cabin so quickly that some passengers perished without so much as a chance to stand up from their seats, while others collapsed..."

I’m talking about standing on the moving walkways in airports. Some airports have addressed this by placing signs “walk left / stand right”. But I am of the opinion, that they have only done that so as not to offend the standers. The so-called people movers purpose is to speed up travel through the concourse, not to give standers a break. Walking on the outside of the walkway is speedier than the standers on the walkway. These standers also clog up the walkway slowing down travelers attempting to make short connections. I say ban standing on these walkways. If you need a break…take a seat at anyone of the many gates around you. Pre boarding flights Smapti June 6, 2023, 4:54am 2 Omar_Little..."

Answer Spare the rod, spoil the child is a modern-day proverb on the wisdom of discipline. It means that, if a parent refuses to discipline an unruly child, that child will grow accustomed to getting his own way and develop an air of entitlement. He will become, in the common vernacular, a spoiled brat. Spare the rod, spoil the child is not found in Scripture, but Proverbs 13:24 expresses a similar thought: “He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.” According to this..."

Why do children spin around & turn upside down? Have you ever wondered why your child just can’t sit still?  Or why they seem to prefer being upside down?   Or how on earth they can really manage that fairground ride again?  Children need to spin, roll, and swing indoors and outdoors.  Brain research shows us that movement not only helps children develop their motor skills but also helps to alleviate stress and anxiety. Our nervous system is responsible for pumping information to the brain just as the heart pumps blood around the body.  The brain monitors the in..."

She was sitting in a youth Bible-study group, surrounded by her peers, and losing patience.

Spinning, rolling, and swinging! Oh my! Posted: October 17, 2017 Children need the dizzying input that comes from spinning, rolling, and swinging. These important movement experiences help the child’s nervous system to mature and organize. Many adults eventually start to dislike the feeling of spinning or repetitive swinging, but for children, it is a crucial sensory and motor skill input. Children need to spin, roll, and swing indoors and outdoors. One preschool team wondered how the tone of their room would change if they created an indoor gross motor area. They were worried that it would be loud and distracting, but they found just the opposite. When children were allowed to use their big muscles and move in active ways, their minds and their emotions settled more easily to focus on other play later in the schedule. Thi..."

The child pencils 13 in the blank. “How did you get that answer?” the teacher asks. “I added the 4 and the 3 and the 6 and got 13,” the child replies. But as the child is talking, he holds one hand under the 6 on the left and the other hand under the 6 on the right, indicating that the child has, at least implicitly, noticed the 6s on both sides of the equation. Thus, the teacher realizes, it is a small mental leap to see that these equal numbers would cancel each other out and that the remaining numbers on the left can be added to get the correct answer, 7. The teacher says, “A better way to solve the problem would be to add the 4 and ..."

When we breathe out slowly on our hands, the warmth and moisture from our mouths has time to transfer to our hands, warming them up. But pursing our lips speeds up the airflow, and as this passes over our hands, it blasts away any air that’s been warmed by contact with our hands, cooling them. In addition, the fast-moving column of air draws in, or ‘entrains’, the air around it. This tends to be cooler than our breath, s..."

Leave a Comment / Articles & Advice, Pet Care By Talitha Mulder August 18, 2024 Have you noticed your cat doing a bit of a double take when someone new walks through the door? Maybe they puff up, give a cautious sniff, or dart under the bed. Cats are mysterious little beings, aren’t they? But what’s going on in their furry heads when a stranger appears? Let’s dive deep into how cats react to strangers and whether it’s really all about character. Cats typically react to strangers with caution, displaying behaviours ranging from curiosity to fear. Some may approach new people confidently, while others may hide or become defensive. These reactions often depend on the cat’s personality, past experiences, and the stran..."

If you haven’t spent much time around cats, you may have the impression they’re aloof or unapproachable. Perhaps you’ve always considered yourself a “dog person” and find it hard to figure out why cats don’t respond in the same way as your favorite canine. Maybe this is your first cat and you’re trying to make friends but don’t quite know the correct approach. It’s really easy to start the bonding process with a cat but if you’re confused or need some advice, I have some important tips that can make a big difference in successful trust-building.

The cat will notice your arrival and will be watching you. While I can’t prove it makes a difference, I think it is helpful for the cat to see you and the owner together having a relaxed, friendly chat. When you are hauling gear and moving from place to place under the tree during your climbing preparations, it is best to move in a slow, relaxed manner. Fast-paced, back-and-forth walking appears too similar to the movements of an excited predator on the cat’s trail looking for a way to reach him. When I am in a rushed rescue situation – such as an approaching storm – I often must force myself to slow down and remind myself that going slow is the fastest way to get the cat down.I make it a point never to yell while I am ..."

Not sure of details, sounds like kids being mean. He's not close friends with anyone at the table, but doesn't have any other close friends in his lunch period. He told me he sat by himself at an empty table and he was OK with that... But the thought really kills me. He's in the awkward stage of making new friends at a new school (8th grade) and I'm being sympathetic and telling him to just sit somewhere else with anyone who is in one of his classes, but he's saying nobody he knows is there.

This parent says they’ve tried just removing his food when he isn’t cooperating, but then “he ends up hangry… and it’s so difficult to get anything done.” So, they’ve resorted to feeding him through distractions and by following him around with food at home, in the park, and in his Yes Space while he’s playing. Eventually, he finishes a meal. Janet offers this family a shift in perspective and mealtime guidelines that not only encourage healthy eating but eliminate stress for us and our kids.

Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a behavior and its consequence (Table 6.1).

Will they have good or despicable table manners? Will they marvel or complain about the food? Will they listen thoughtfully as family members share what they’re thankful for or, instead, start throwing peas at their cousins? As parents, we often put a lot of pressure on ourselves on family holidays. We also put a lot of pressure on our kids. We expect them to step up and behave the ways we want — the ways we think will reflect well on us. But let’s face it: They often do the opposite.I’m here today to tell you that it’s okay if your kids act like demons this Thanksgiving. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent or that you have bad kids. Children are often on their worst behavior over the hol..."
