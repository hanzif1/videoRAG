We all need to accept that institutional and systemic racism is still prevalent in our society today. Author: Alex LeederOne of the things that has come out of the most recent Black Lives Matter campaign and protests has been the notion that “All Lives Matter”. A counter-statement, if you will.This is a notion that no-one has ever disputed, and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement do not disagree with it.I have heard a lot of white people becoming very defensive of themselves during this period.

Within a few hours, we were already wondering if our plan to spend a month there had been a huge mistake.The next morning, our bad mood was emboldened by torrential rains—but after a harrowing ride with a cab driver to whom speed limits were merely suggestions, we finally arrived at the Forbidden City. We had taken shelter under the cover of one of the arched gates and were waiting for our guide to arrive when we noticed something.People were staring at us—and snapping pictures.As we looked around, we realized tha..."

The story behind the iconic ‘Tank Man’ photo Photographs by Jeff Widener/APStory by Kyle Almond, CNN A man blocks a line of tanks on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989. At first, Jeff Widener was annoyed by the man entering his shot. Widener, a photographer with the Associated Press, was focusing his camera on a line of tanks in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square when out of the blue came this man in a white shirt and dark trousers, carrying what appeared to be shopping bags. Widener thought the man was going to mess up the composition of his frame. Little did he know that he was about to make one of the most iconic photos in history. Before “Tank Man,” pro-democracy demonstrators had been occupying Tiananmen Square for weeks. Here, a young woman is caught between civilians and Chinese soldiers who were trying to remove her from an assembly near the Great Hall of the..."

Their odd body language and strange habits are part of why we love them so much. But what do those weird cat behaviors actually mean? Since domestication has been a relatively recent development for cats, some things cats once did to survive may have no adaptive value now that they are adored members of the modern-day household. But there is or was a pay-off for them somewhere along the line, or else they wouldn’t bother to do them. The key is to figure out what motivates the traits we find odd in our cats.
