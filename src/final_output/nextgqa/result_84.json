My cousins, Vania and Flynn, were sixteen and eighteen, so they, of course, didn’t want a five-year-old hanging out with them.

There is a car on my street in LIC that has never moved and i have never seen a ticket on it. I am ruling out that the guy has been collecting the tickets because at this point I think the car would have been booted.

Physics I know that internal forces cannot change the momentum of a system, so how do you explain the momentum seemingly gained by the swing here? I guess the same would apply to someone \"jerking\" their body to move something that they're floating on in water. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.

Clay soil is the best at holding water, followed by loam soil, and then sand soil. Step 1: The problem is to investigate how much water different soil types can hold. The question is: How much water can different soil types hold? Step 2: The hypothesis is that different soil types will hold different amounts of water. This is because different soil types have different particle sizes and structures, which affect their ability to absorb and retain water. Step 3: The experiment involves collecting samples of different soil types, such as clay, sand, and loam. Each soil sample is placed in a container with a known volume of water. After a set amount of time, the amount of water remaining in each container is measured. Step 4: The observations are rec..."

It was 1914, the summer after my brother, Dan, died in the west field and not long before America got into the First World War. I’ve never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day, and I never will. I’ve decided to write it down, though, in this book, which I will leave on the table beside my bed. I can’t write long, because my hands shake so these days and I have next to no strength, but I don’t think it will take long.Later, someone may find what I have writt..."

It made sense. What I was doing, it was pretty much community service. Not the kind mandated by a judge. This was more self-imposed. Eight months ago, not drunk or in a rush or driving through the rain, I’d skipped through a stop sign after picking my son up from third grade, ran us into a furniture truck.
