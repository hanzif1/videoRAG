So nowadays I look forward to these opportunities to get my bumper car ride fix, dragging my (grown up) sons along if they're in town. Bumper cars used to be a staple of these traveling carnival rides, but now they'r..."

I’ll start with the verses we typically use around exercise, but may we be careful not to pull these out of context and make them into fitness rules. My hope here is to display Scripture as truth to inform and guide our movement practice, not to define it. What I’ve found over the years is that the Bible does not prescribe fitness in any one way. I'll lay out some verses, but go ahead and ask God what He means for you and your relationship with exercise in light of His Word. May this post open your minds and hearts from a narrow view of fitness to joyful movement and obedience to the One who loves us and moves toward us.

At the table, my friend’s 9-year-old daughter challenged me with a riddle. You might be familiar with it. A father and son are involved in a serious car accident.

My friend’s daughter was looking at me as if I had three he..."

In fact, it has been suggested that body language makes up 55% of communication, with the other 45% consisting of tone and words.While many nonverbal cues can be interpreted the same way regardless of gender, men often stand, gesture, and use their eyes in specific ways.

Or like swinging down but with only hands/arms? There's many ways to describe this like this sample video. It's a common swing used by younger kids or adults with less experience. I mean it's an easier swing to learn since your hands/arms are closer to the bat than your hips. It seems like a lot of the hitting coach videos try to phase out of this swing. At what age and competitive level do kids absolutely have to learn the proper way of swinging or the flaws of that swing will get exposed? Read more Share New to Re..."

Under the shade of a sturdy pin oak, I leaned back against the swingset’s stanchion and watched her fling her legs out while she leaned back, then tilt upright and push against the chains, swinging herself back and forth for the first time under her own power. I should have been happier, I know, and part of me was, but another part of me felt like a veteran third baseman watching a hotshot rookie steal his spot in the lineup. She could do it herself now.

This is a column on the subject that is on a far more mundane level. It was a quiet summer evening and the tide was at the full. I had been kayaking in the estuary between Borth-y- Gest and Portmeirion, and was returning to the harbour slipway by allowing the gentle breeze to guide me gently there.

A harmless way of destroying something without any permanence… Yesterday was another lovely, peaceful day, of course its ruhetag (rest day) here in Germany so naturally, everything comes in a slow pace.

So the other day I noticed a couple holding hands, walking down the street, with the woman on the side closer to the road, but she switched places so the guy was between her and the road. I also had a girlfriend that frequently did this but never asked why, but now I wish I did haha. Is this a super common female behavior in heterosexual couples? If so, what's the reasoning behind it?

Verse 32 says, “They departed to a desert place”. People saw where they were heading, when they arrived there were thousands of people waiting for them. Jesus began to teach them.

We’re in the desert, we don’t have food for all these people”. Jesus asked them for what they had. They gave him two fish and five loaves of bread.

Fast forward a week, we’re at my house, (I live alone) and things are going well. I must add tho that we smoked a few joints in the evening before going up to bed. So we’re getting into it, he has a mild panic and makes sure I definitely wanna go ahe..."

You already know that opening wide is the key to a better latch — but when you can’t figure out how to actually get your baby to do it, every feed can feel frustrating. Here’s the truth: most babies can open wide — they just need the right cue. And the one you’ve probably been taught often doesn’t work.

He seemed fine, until we removed his blue halter. Now, we are in danger. A donkey can kill a coyote, wolf or mountain lion with a single kick. And the bite force of a donkey is so powerful, it can crush bone. The Flood We adopted two donkeys from Peaceful Valley a month earlier. We named them Calvin and Hobbes. It was a busy time. I had to find a vet, farrier, and hay. I had to buy a truck and trailer. But life with donkeys was good, until it began to rain. The deluge lasted three weeks. In the paddock, grass turned to mud. Calvin got thrush (an infected hoof). Hobbes got grumpy. When the vet came by for a wellness chec..."

It was like a layer of cotton placed on the water. The banks themselves were indistinct, hidden behind strange fogs. But day was breaking and the hill was becoming visible. In the dawning light of day the plaster houses began to appear like white spots. Cocks were crowing in the barnyard. On the other side of the river, hidden behind the fogs, just opposite Frette, a slight noise from time to time broke the dead silence of the quiet morning. At times it was an indistinct plashing, like the cautious advance of a boat, then again a sharp noise like the rattle of an oar and then the sound of something dropping in the water. Then silence. Sometimes whispered words, coming perhaps from a distance, perhaps from quite near, pierced through these opaque mists. They passed by like wild birds which have s..."

In fencing, the black card is the method that officials use to remove a fencer from competition when they break the code of honor. Severe offences mean an ejection in fencing. While sport is at its heart about good will and good sportsmanship, unfortunate events like ejections do happen. After the USA Fencing strengthened its protocols on the black card a few weeks ago, it’s be..."

Friday morning the 29th my rather large cat consumed a 2 foot long (thin and narrow) Christmas ribbon. I called and took him immediately to the vet— they induced vomiting— nothing. They told me to keep an eye on him.. Thankfully the day it happened, I had the day off so I could stay with him. The 30th my work generously let me come in late so I could drop him off with the vet. The 31st (today, happy new years) he stayed with a friend that is a vet tech. he is e..."

Miscellaneous and Personal Stuff I Must Share JohnM May 11, 2004, 7:17pm 1 In January we adopted two ginger cats from a local cat rescue society. Diana and Mercury are about 13 months old, and, seeing as how our previous cats were 14 and 20 years old when they died, are reintroducing us to the joys of younger, more active cats. Last night I caught Mercury swallowing the last of a 12 to 18\" blue cloth ribbon. After googling, it looks like this could be quite serious, or nothing much. My wife called the vet this morning, and was told to be on the lookout for the signs of intestinal blockage, but that things may just work themselves out. So Doper cat owners, have your felines done anything like this and survived, or at least survived without abdominal surgery? I guess I’m looking for a confidence l..."

Or, maybe it’s more of a mournful holler? Regardless: Every single night without fail for about six weeks now, Newtie yowls. She goes upstairs while we’re downstairs–it’s only ever if we’re on separate levels–and she yowls. Then she picks up a cat toy in her mouth while still vocalizing, carries the cat toy somewhere else, drops it, and yowls some more. As..."

We were to be delayed five or six hours, and therefore we took horses, by invitation, and joined a party who were just starting on a buffalo hunt. It was noble sport galloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning, but our part of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace, for a wounded buffalo bull chased the passenger Bemis nearly two miles, and then he forsook his horse and took to a lone tree. He was very sullen about the matter for some twenty-four hours, but at last he began to soften little by little, and finally he said: \"Well, it was not funny, and there was no sense in those gawks making themselves so facetious over it. I tell you I was angry in earnest for awhile. I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank, if I could have done it without crippling six or seven other people--but of cours..."

My dream had been for many years to ride a horse, by myself, through the most remote part of the most uninhabited country of the world: Bayan Ulgi province, the most western province of Mongolia, bordering China and Russia. Home of the Altai Mountains, home of the eagle hunters, home of an incredibly hospitable, colourful, strong and welcoming Kazakh culture. I had been on a horse maybe ten days in my life and arranged with Stepperiders (a horse trekking company) to volunteer with them before heading off on a solo trek. Volunteering is quite expensive though (circa 200 dollars a week) and the solo trek training they offer even more so. I heard many stories of people being very disappointed with the solo trek training. But I was lucky to be included in a seven day trek the day after I arrived. The group included two tourists, t..."

We did a few takes of different parts of the interview and it was hard to know whether to embellish what I’d said each time or to say the same thing again. There’s so much material to use but you only have seconds in which to say it, and the entire segment on sidesaddle was six minutes long.
