Their fingers cannot even hold crayons correctly yet and I’m teaching to play an instrument? Well, my explanation is quite simple. We got a piano as a gift. 🙂 For me, that spells FUN and DISCOVERY! Of course she could just press those white and black (in our case, red) keys all she wants. But she could also discover that those notes actually make up the nursery rhymes that she always hears.

Of course she’s still very very young but I’d like to get her something that’s a little bit more serious than a keyboard from Mellisa and Doug so as she grows we can do more things on it. My first question is, is this a good choice in keyboard for the purpose?

Their odd body language and strange habits are part of why we love them so much. But what do those weird cat behaviors actually mean? Since domestication has been a relatively recent development for cats, some things cats once did to survive may have no adaptive value now that they are adored members of the modern-day household.

Cats can be friendly, playful, affectionate, cuddly creatures. But sometimes they seem to bite out of nowhere, leaving owners confused. Why your cat bites can be based on several reasons, but there are options to stop this unwanted – and sometimes painful reaction. Why do cats bite?

Since the age of 8, my mom would stand in front of a door until I opened it for her. She aspired to raise me as a gentleman, just like her father, my namesake, was.This article doesn’t simply go through the boring basics of chivalry — it strives to go deeper. There are reasons behind the rules. And then there are ways of thinking about being a gentleman that simply go beyond rules.You’ll notice most of these tips are “gendered,” but I think they can apply to any situation in which one person wants to make someone else feel taken care of — which is the simple goal of all gentlemen.But, if you still find some of this sexist, you can take it up with my mom.1) If You Do Nothing Else, Just Keep Your Radar Up.

Here are the definitions of lay and lie (from Merriam-Webster): · lay: to put or set down · lie: to be at rest in a horizontal position Even Nobel Laureates Make Mistakes Bob Dylan incorrectly uses the word lay in the song “Lay, Lady, Lay” (from his 1969 album Nashville Skyline). Dylan sings, “Lay, lady, lay / Lay across my big brass bed.” Because he is inviting the lady to rest on the bed, he should have sung, “Lie, lady, lie / Lie across my big brass bed.” If he were instead asking the lady to put something on his bed, lay would be correct (for example, “Lay, lady, lay / Lay a blanket across my big brass bed”).

Also a treat bag , tennis ball and something to send the dog around ( cone ). Now that you all have your dogs paying attention to a tennis ball and returning it to your hand , we move on to teaching the dog to catch the ball. Dont over face your dog with expecting it to catch the ball from a distance. Keep the dog close to you at first. Once the dog has mastered the catch then use a cone or something similar to send your dog around then you throw the ball towards the dog as it returns to you. This will teach the dog to catch while it's on the move . Dog heading in one direction and ball in the other. You will notice that i only ever reward the dog when it gets the catch, even when the dog returns the ball to my hand after picking it up off the ground i do not reward as thats not what i am training.

Posted in Daily Musings, Dating, Love by Liz This morning on the way into work, I was listening to the Wild 102.9 morning show on the radio. They were talking about a new study that Ok Cupid released about dating. I can’t find the study online, but the jist of it is this: Men are more likely to message/approach a woman who is moderately attractive vs. a woman who is beautiful because the chances of rejection are lower and therefore less of a threat to their egos.

Also, if you don’t approach, why not? I guess I’d think if a person doesn’t approach then they are not really interested although I could be wrong.

Sometimes they consistently break devices or furniture, or take them apart. What many frustrated parents and caregivers may not understand is that there is usually a reason behind these urges; it’s not just random autistic behavior. And if parents can try to figure out why their children have these needs, and then accommodate them as much as they can, everyone can have a much easier time. Not always, but in many cases.

The reason for this is because of their ability to blend in with the environment they are in at any given time.

Loving film is completely different. For those who see film enjoy them, yet only those who can read film truly love it and understand it as an art form. Hitchcock is probably the most well known director of all time. There is no absolute answer to what his crowning achievement is. A lot of critics prefer “Vertigo”. Taste varies from one film lover to the other. “North by Northwest”, “Notorious”, “Vertigo”, “Rear Window”, “The Birds”, “Shadow of a Doubt”, “Strangers on a Train”, “Rebecca”, “Suspicion”, “The 39 Steps” and “Psycho” are among his most loved.
