Cats walking nearby and suddenly flopping over on their back with a wriggle called the social roll, but why do they do it? Like all cat postures, there are subtle variations of meaning but whether it’s a human or animal watching them, it’s a friendly, non-aggressive stance demonstrating comfort. Comfort is a key point. I’ve seen my cats gallivant happily in the rain and snow but not once have they rolled on their back in cold weather. Also, if they are all alone having a dirt bath, I wouldn’t call it a social role since they might be simply scratching an itch. I’..."

You’ve just walked in after a long day at work. Your cat greets you at the door, stretching one long back leg behind him, and then the other. You’ve woken your cat from a nap for a meal. She gets up, arches her back dramatically, and saunters to the bowl. Your cat has just woken from a midday snooze. She rouses herself with a ferocious yawn, stretches both front paws out in front and dips into a perfect downward dog. When cats aren’t eating, sleeping, or playing, they’re stretching. Am I right? Actually…I’m not right. None of the behaviors I..."

This question mark  hip shift brings some questions of their own, specifically, why did that happen, is it something that is going to lead to an injury, and what can someone do to help correct or prevent it?

The commonality they tend to share is that they are not evenly distributing the yielding or production of force on both sides of their body (to the extent they need to). A hip shift in a squat (or deadlift) is not inherently a problem that needs to be addressed. However, when there is discomfort present, it absolutely needs consideration. Here is one athlete I train who is a college basketball player. Here are some of the most relevant assessment measures that we had (all numbers are in degrees): Hip Flexion (a measurement of pelvic external rotation): Left: 105 Right: 95 This indicates he can get deeper into a squat on the left side.

Today, while doing my B-workout of the SSLP, I noticed during the squat that I heavily lean onto my right (healthy) leg. This happens right at the time when the eccentric portion of the move turns into concentric (which is probably understandable, as the left leg is noticeably weaker and has been injured 12 years ago). What I did after squatting was, I took a good look at myself in the mirror (no pun intended) and tried to note as many details as possible so here it goes: left foot - weighted more medially than laterally (kind of like if there was a very slight flat foot or arch drop); medial malleolus more “medially displaced” if that is a term..."

I know how to squat properly, from the side the form looks good, back isn’t rounding, when I reach the hole, back is straight also, everything’s ok, but whenever I’m going up, my lower back goes to the right side. This thing happens just outside the hole, after that bending, I can go up properly.

Most of these seem to happen with small birds, such as budgies (parakeets) and cockatiels. \"The bowl looks full but it's not!\" Learn how to recognize eaten seed vs. edible seed. Birds who eat seed leave behind hulls that can be mistaken for whole seeds. I've heard of owners leaving the food bowl in without changing it for days, resulting in a bird that starves to death \"with a full foodbowl.\" (Food and water should be replaced daily at minimum.) \"If it's not on the ground, it's not food.\" Some young birds, especially young budgies, don't know how to eat (or drink) from their new bowls. They don't recognize the contents as food; they only know how to eat seed off the cage floor. If you notice a new bird not eating from its bowl for a long time, you may want to try lowering the foodbowl and/or putting a shallow saucer of food on the floor for the bird to s..."

I’ve lived with birds for the majority of my life, and they’ve brought a quality to my life that I think only a close relationship with one of the most intelligent animal species is capable of providing. The depth and intensity of the bond that forms between a parrot and its keeper is unrivaled by any other pet. I’m the person everyone calls when they’re considering getting their first bird. Unfortunately, I’m also the person everyone calls when they can no longer tolerate or care for their parrot. ..."

Members Online • LucidITSkyWDiamonds Why do some players move their fretboard back an forth when playing long notes /uj thread Why do some players (mostly youtubers I've seen do this tbh) rock the fretboard back an forth on long notes (refrain from any \"cuz its rock music hurr durr\" jokes pls) while not doing any bending at all. Like, I've it on acoustic guitars and there's sonically 0 difference so why the hell do they do it? Is it to show they're playing with emotion? I honestly don't get it at all.

One looks like a floppy-eared black fox, the other a lanky brown-and-white brindle character with a long, white-tipped tail. The two dogs maintain a distance of 9 to 10 feet between them at all times. They run one direction, with one dog in pursuit and the other being chased.

I'll take a liberty here and guess that the rules state that the gearbox has to be mechanically actuated because I've seen the shifter paddle pull on something (a cable?), but how come they don't extend the paddle to the other side of the wheel (only a single paddle still) so that pulling on the left side would push the right one away, actuating a downshift? I can't imagine pushing is that much faster, even with the acceleration helping. I've only ever driven H-patterns, so I might be wrong though. Read more Share New to Reddit?

Advice kayaking-technique system September 17, 2008, 2:54pm #1 Okay, so I have owed an ocean kayak sit on top for years and never had any problems steering it, though do struggle with strong tides, but I took a beginners class with a friend and they put me in a dagger… about 12-14 feet. We were doing fine until I went to paddle harder and faster and it started tracking to the left. I wasn’t leaning. The paddle was offset, not adjustable, but I could paddle five strokes left and would still veer left. There was not tide, no wind. I was pulling straight back and stopping at the hip. It was very frustrating. I even checked to see if the rudder was up. I tried doing a sweep to correct and it made it worse and kept having to sweep back to the right to course correct, slowing me down. Any ideas if it was me or the boat? I have had this happen before in the canoe when a side wind hit me, b..."

She catches it, but then it happens again just a few feet away going through the next set of doors as they stepped out into the cold from the movie theater.

Even before Zack and I got married, he always did one little thing that I absolutely adore. He always opened the door. Not just restaurant doors and house doors. He opened (and still does) my car door too. Every time I get in or out of the car, he opens my door for me – regardless of who is driving. Does he need to open my door? No. Am I perfectly capable of opening my own door? Yes. But this little act of chivalry has taught me huge lessons about our God-defined roles as men and women.

I see a man opening the back door of a taxi or an Uber for a woman and then stepping aside to let her get in and scoot herself across the back seat so that he can get in after her. While I applaud the gesture to open the door, I feel obliged to share that there is another step in being a real gentleman in this instance. Clearly, the man is trying to do the right thing, so I give him a 10 for the thought, but a 5 for partial execution. The right way to be a gentleman in opening the car door is to open the door closest to the sidewalk for a woman or an elderly person, let them take the immediate seat, ask if you may close the door, and then close it and go on th..."

Be sure she has emptied her bladder then ask her to lie on her back. There are four maneuvers that are done in sequence. First: Put both your hands flat on the mother’s belly and feel the top of the uterus with the palms and fingers of both hands. Most often you will feel the baby’s bottom..."

It’s not like startle reflux where their hands shoot up- it’s their normal state. Just when awake, laying on back with hands out in front of them raised and/or flailing around like they’re reaching for something. Been doing this pretty much since born and now 10 weeks. Never thought anything of it until recently and saw another kid of similar age with much more relaxed arms when lying on back. She is otherwise hitting all milestones on time or ahead of schedule.
