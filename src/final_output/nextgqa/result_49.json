It’s kinda hard to get it while just listening It’s way easier when reading or with subtitles. ((I quoted from memory so maybe not super accurate)) Read more Share New to Reddit..."

November 9, 2019 Denise Thank you to our guest writer, Nomi Berger! It’s an open secret that cats ENJOY playing with ribbon. In fact, anything resembling a ribbon – be it string, yarn or twine, shoelaces, tinsel or rubber bands – is a cause for kitty cat celebration.

Tshirts, dresses, pants, you name it. The only thing I would always consistently wash first before wearing was underwear. Well, this past weekend I wore a brand new pair of jeans and took them off at the end of the day to find my legs covered in itchy red bumps.

My answer is this is not load-bearing at all. Rather, things like ‘situational awareness’ in AI systems are a symptom of something fiendishly complex happening inside the system which we can neither fully explain or predict - this is inherently very scary, and for the purpose of my feelings and policy ideas it doesn’t matter whether this behavior stems from some odd larp..."

Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.

This radical notion lies at the heart of a new proposal by the mineralogist Robert Hazen and the astrobiologist Michael Wong at Carnegie Science in Washington, DC. In this short documentary, they explain why they believe a ‘law of increasing functional information’ could help us better understand why everything from atoms to cells to civilisations seems to grow more complex and orderly over time. They suggest that, if information is as fundamental as mass or energy, it could not only account for the similar ways so many systems appear to behave, but also help p..."

Not sure if it was a movie or a TV movie. The only part I remember is the ending scene. One of the main characters (an adult) meets a kid in a desert or somewhere similar. The kid is African American. The adult starts saying \"why did you do it?!\", or something, I can't remember. The kid remains silent, and suddenly his knees bend backwards like an ostrich. I think it made gross snapping/popping noises too. He then takes off running. I..."

Members • Jumpy-Persimmon3287 中文 (繁體) Why is Melanie always tapping her mic now? Question I noticed in her latest performances she’s been doing this thing with her hands where she’s kind of waving her fingers on and off the mic. It seems almost like a nervous tic because it’s not to the rhythm or anything like that. I looked back at old performances and realized she hasn’t done that in the past from what I can tell… I hope this doesn’t come across as rude I’m just concerned about her tbh I hope she’s feeling ok esp in all the costume. I heard she quit smoking recently so maybe it’s a withdrawal symptom. Idk what do you guys think? Read more Share New to..."

The project succeeds 3F, which ended in December 2024. The past few years have shown that festivals cannot be taken for granted: a record number of festivals has announced shutting down, extreme weather conditions are increasingly creating existential challenges for outdoor events, the cost of living crisis has of course also had an impact on festivals and fans, and the repe..."

One thing however I can't stop thinking about after the movie is trying to comprehend Jean Jacket's anatomy and its nature. Even after the anatomy sketch posted on this sub, I still am a bit confused. Throughout the movie we occasionally see scenes (namely the opening credits) of a... pulsing(?) square (Not to be confused with the pulsing square seen in JJ's final moments). It almost looks like a metallic hallway. I assumed this to be the \"eye\" of JJ, however I don't believe it is since the mouth on JJ is circular, so if the eye is looking out of the mouth, wouldn't these scenes have a circular looking \"hallway\"? Speaking of pulsing squares... What the hell..."

Much has been made about the lives lost in the Batmobile chase scene, and some (including myself) have questioned as to why Gordon would have just let the Penguin go after the shootout (including shooting at him, an honest GCPD officer, no less) along with the mass carnage/vehicular homicide the Penguin is directly responsible for during the car chase, but I'm not here to re-litigate that. I want to rewind back to the end of the shootout, where the Penguin is stalking over to the downed Batman's position. He's disappeared, of course, and stealthily made it into his car without even his allies (like Selina) noticing his recovery. But then something inexplicable happens. Batman goa..."

I enjoyed Forgotten Realms and the classic \"gathering my party to venture forth\" from a tavern where we received a quest to go find some treasure. Usually an elf was the most exotic or strange party member who would garner attention from local villagers or farmers as they had never actually seen one in person before. If there were any Tiefling or Drow with us they would surely have worn a disguise to avoid drawing too much attention to themselves. Slaying an ogre or band of orcs was quite the accomplishment for a group of eager level 2 adventurers, enough to earn a reward from the local mayor and a reputation in the area.

It's perfectly normal,hamsters and especially dwarf hamsters love to dig and hide. Plus, your hamster is new to this environment and is a bit stressed out.He's still exploring. In time your hamster will be calmer and will run around his cage and will be coming to you too when you open his cage. iYuuki 2012-04-15 23:20:29 UTC He's stressed out. Think about it, he's just taken a trip from the breeding facility to the pet store, and then to your house. Give him a few days to adjust to his new home, leave him alone while he..."

Members • OtakuGuy101 中文 (繁體) Why Are Their Hands/Fingers Like This? Over the years that I've been watching anime and reading manga, I've always wondered why female characters tend to have their fingers in this certain position. Their middle and ring finger are attached to each other and the rest are spread apart. Don't get me wrong, they look really cute when they do so, but I don't know. Is it just a thing that they do? Are they just trying to act cute? Is this applied to the real world as well (I've not seen one do so) ? What does it represent? Example Read more Archived post.

Members • avery-secret-account A Bad Case Of Stripes is a horrifying book and should never be read to children. Other I’m not sure how many of you remember this book from your childhood but it was a semi popular childrens picture book. It was about a girl who loves Lima beans but doesn’t eat them because her friends don’t like them. Her skin then turns all different colors and patterns, she turns into a giant pill, and even a couch. I have no problem with the story aspect of the book but the pictures are horrifying. As a kid, I had nightmares about this girl and just last night I had my first in years. Read more Share New to Reddit?..."

Posted on June 7, 2022June 7, 2022 by Live & Learn The River Thames is beautiful in early summer, and the stretch just upstream of central London is full of birds: motionless herons watching for fish, bustling moorhens poking around the submerged plants, and watchful flocks of preening swans. But as my canoe club paddles along the river, we’re always looking out for our clear favorites: the mother ducks with a fluffy cluster of ducklings tagging along behind. When they’re lingering at the shore, it all looks slightly chaotic, with baby birds dawdling and exploring as the mother duck keeps an eye on them.

They can watch out for each other, give the alarm when a predator appears, and increase their chances of survival. They also are feeding then, so some can feed while others watch. Groups tend to congregate where there is an ample food supply, so many will gather in one area. They swim to constantly move to fresh hunting areas within the site. anonymous 2007-02-23 17:42:44 ..."

Page Abstract Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while ma..."
