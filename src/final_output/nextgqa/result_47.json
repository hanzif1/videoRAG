I am working on a 3D model of a buggy (from the game C&C Generals Zero Hour). The buggy has cylinder framework at the front. I have designed the rest of the structure but I can’t seem to smoothly join/merge the corner edges of three cylinders where they meet. I have attached the screenshot here. Any help would be appreciated pbacot October 27, 2020, 12:34am 2 Here’s one way with solid tools. I did this with 3 identical cylinders in the blue, red, and green axes, so the quality of the intersection varies if your cylinders are not so cleanly aligned. Each cylinder is a group. Overlap the cylinders past the intersection. Save a copy of the cylinders as they are arranged! S..."

The projections are assumed to arise from rotation about a fixed tilt axis, subject to minor varia- tions from this scheme. The program uses a number of different numerical strategies depending on the complexity of the alignments needed to reconstruct the volume and on whether the computation is being done by the central processing unit (CPU) or the graphical processing unit (GPU). If there are no local alignments being applied, then for processing on the CPU, the program will do a preliminary stretching of each input line by the cosine of the tilt angle. This stretching speeds up the direct back- projection because each stretched input line is in register with the lines of the output planes. The str..."

Do you have difficulties with judging distances or depth? Does your car have a few too many bumps and dents? Difficulties with 3D vision and depth perception could be due to an undiagnosed lazy eye. Stereopsis, more commonly known as 3D depth perception, occurs when your brain combines the two images received from each eye and creates one single 3D image. This allows you to easily engage and interact with the world around you. What is stereopsis? Stereopsis is the visual ability to see your surroundings in th..."

Can 3D Movies Reveal Eye Problems? By Dr. Russel Lazarus If 3D movies cause eye strain or discomfort, you may have a vision problem. 3D movies are becoming all the rage lately. Hollywood puts out more and more new 3D offerings in theaters every year, and an increasing number of television shows allow for 3D viewing as well. But if the 3D experience makes you feel sick or causes headaches, or if you simply can’t see the 3D effect, this could be a sign of undiagnosed vision problems. Fortunately your local eye doctor can help. Binocular vision is vital to see 3D The reason that 3D television and movie experiences work – or don’t – is because of a process known as binocular vision.

Ask any child psychologist and they will tell you that something as simple as getting your child dressed for the day, can be a real battleground in some families. It’s quite common for children to dislike wearing socks, to the point where they pitch a tantrum when getting dressed, or remove them as soon as the parent’s back is turned. On the other hand, there are some children who insist on wearing socks all the time! Is Wearing Socks all the Time Bad? As local podiatrist Trevor Lane points out, there are several reasons we wear socks: to absorb sweat and help keep our feet dry, thus preventing foot odour and problems with tinea and other nasties;to provide warmth in cool weather;to promote sleep at bedtime;to prevent feet from rubbing on shoes..."

Factual Questions Rhythmdvl November 30, 2006, 10:37pm 1 Maybe it’s just observer’s bias. And maybe I mean stage right, but it seems that every time I’ve seen a concert pianist when there are no other restrictions (i.e. he/she’s not part of a larger band), the piano sits so the player’s right shoulder faces the audience. Is this just some convention? Is it just me and the pianists I seem to have seen? Is it because the right hand gets the melody and therefore gets all the attention? (Those of us in the Rhythm section don’t know how we feel about that, but don’t want to get into pianist envy in this thread.) Could it have to do with the way pianos are built (i.e. sound)? Some mysterious piano mojo? Thanks, Rhythm Frosted_Glass November 30, 2006, 10:43pm 2 I have no clue but I am really curious about the answer to this one. I just cam..."
