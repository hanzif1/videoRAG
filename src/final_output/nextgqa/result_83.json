Henry (1862-1910) Approximate Word Count: 4372 It looked like a good thing: but wait till I tell you. We were down South, in Alabama--Bill Driscoll and myself-when this kidnapping idea struck us. It was, as Bill afterward expressed it, \"during a moment of temporary mental apparition\"; but we didn't find that out till later. There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course. It contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a Maypole. Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with. We talked it over on the front steps of the hotel. Philoprogenitiveness, says we, is strong in semi-rural communities therefore, and for other reasons, a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius ..."

Why are people so willing to give him the benefit of the doubt? I really don't get it. Obviously the league is going to look more negatively on a player who has such a chequered recent history of hitting people in the groin, whether intentionally or otherwise.

JamieW August 30, 2025, 9:01pm 2 Oh, what a sweet and tender moment you’ve described! When someone looks down after catching your gaze, it’s often the most beautiful sign of shyness and perhaps a flutter of attraction - like a delicate flower turning away from the sun’s gentle warmth.

Signs of interest can be easy to recognize in body language and eye contact, but spotting when a woman falls in love is harder to see. Not only is it rarer, but the signs she’s falling for you are, in many ways, even more, complex and subtle. So subtle that you could miss them even if she’s your best friend.

This is the episode in which Bailey's baby is badly injured and is rushed to the ER. I was pissed off at Bailey's behavior. I know some of you will tell me it's normal because her child is in the hospital. From my point of view, it is undrinkable and in several respects.

Entertaining her with a rattle or singing to her used to work, but not anymore. It’s been getting progressively worse. The pediatrician says there are no issues and she is fine, but I feel like there is something wrong and this can’t be normal.

Jay Elizabeth Brownlee October 29, 2020 Share Leave a comment I've seen a thing doing the rounds about the 'Coke bottle effect'. Those of us with neurodivergent children will be aware of this concept.It serves to explain why teachers say our kids are \"fine\" or \"had a really good day\" and yet the second they get home (or sometimes even before we've left the school gates) they blow up in our face.Watch: What life is like with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Post continues after the video. Video viaIn simplicity, you imagine the child is a bottle of Coke. Every time something stressful happens the bottle is shaken. Nothing much seems to change.

I have noticed this in more than one situation. If I put baby formula powder and water in a baby bottle, hold my finger over the hole and shake it, the liquid will foam somewhat. When I take my finger off the hole, the pressure inside has clearly increased and liquid squirts out. The same thing happens if you add some water to an almost empty bottle of dishwashing soap and shake it so you can get the last bit out. It doe..."

Candle wax is one of the chemicals in the reaction. Can you guess what the wax reacts with? Find out in this experiment! What to do 1. Ask the adult you are working with to light the candle. 2. Watch the candle flame start out small and get bigger. Notice how some of the wax near the wick melts. 3. As the flame burns, the wax from the candle is reacting with something else to make the flame. What do you think it might be? 4. Ask the adult you are working with to carefully place a glass jar over the candle and to leave it there. What to expect The flame will go out. What’s happening in there? Why does the flame go out when the jar is covering it? The substance that reacts with the candle wax is oxy..."

The Water-Candle experiment is an illustrative example. It is a situation where many different effects play together and where it is hard to figure out, which ones really matter. My own perspective about this experiment has shifted several times and comments of some who wrote me added valuable insight. Please look also towards the end of this page, where some interesting links are added and information like why the great Lavoisier himself replaced this experiment as it appeared to be too subtle. Experiment: Cover a burning candle with a pitcher so that the candle is in an air-tight room sealed by the water at the ground. Observations: After some time, the candle dims and goes out. Just before the candle dies, the water level rises to almost 1/10 th of pitche..."

Because of this, it can be important to be able to interpret the body language and nonverbal communication of the women in your life accurately.Understanding and reading female body language can also help people understand women better as a whole. Let’s take a look at what body language can mean, and how women in the U.S. can convey their emotions and attitudes through their body language cues.**It can be helpful to keep in mind that there are no general hard and f..."

Bumblebee Transformers by Monkey Boy Of the OAFEs, I would definitely say I have the least affinity for Transformers. I grew up with my share, like most boys, and I liked the Alternators line as I'm something of a car buff, but I just never got into Energon, Cybertron, or Whatevertron. Despite this, or maybe because of it, I'm probably the staunchest OAFE defender of the 2007 Michael Bay Transformers film. I liked it. A lot. Before I saw the movie, I didn't have much interest in the toys. Upon seeing the film, however, I had to get my hands on a little piece of the movie I could take home. And the one I wanted most of all was the star of the show. No, not Optimus Prime - Bumblebee. The first main wave of Transformers movie figures gave us a Bumblebee, but it sucked hard. Based on Bumblebee's initial look (a beat up '76 Camaro), it featured opaque windows and a few airbrushed spots o..."

My friend Barry Schwabsky had discovered Pullman’s novel Galatea (1978) on the new books shelf in the library; after reading it, he passed it on to me. I read it too, and found it utterly remarkable. Galatea was (and still is) is sui generis, not much like anything else I have ever read. It’s a fantasy novel for adults, but very different from Tolkien or any other fantasy that I know of. At the start of the book, the narrator’s wife leaves him, and in order to find her again — though he never does — he embarks on a strange journey that takes him to Amazonia, where he encounters strange ruined or unfinished cities, and strange beings, some of whom have supernatural powers, and much of the time whose gender and sexuality do not fit into our usual binaries.

Research suggests that around 75% of individuals, regardless of their handedness, instinctively use their non-dominant arm to cradle a baby.Several theories, including the possibility of improved heartbeat or hearing communication, have been proposed. However, the most likely explanation is the convenience of keeping the dominant hand free for multitasking while holding a baby.Key Facts:Research involving 765 participants aged 4-86 found that 75% of people cradle a doll in the crook of their non-dominant arm.The prevailing theory suggests that this behavior is linked to our preference for keeping the dominant hand free for other tasks.The phenomenon primarily applies to holding babi..."

There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course. It contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a Maypole. Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with.

The most enduring legacy of that period is the friendships. The snippets of things learnt, which flash before me now and then, are that period’s unexpected bonus. “God gave us our memories so that we might have roses in December.” J. M. Barrie’s assertion is more one of philosophy than psychology, and more of the 19th than the 21st century.

Its fame stems from its usage by Winston Churchill as publicised by his doctor, Charles Wilson the 1st Baron Moran. Moran published Winston Churchill: The struggle for survival, 1940-1965 in 1966 to much controversy about his apparent breach of doctor-patient confidentiality. Within the 900-page volume he spoke candidly about Churchill’s struggles with depression, something he referred to as Churchill’s ‘black moods’ or the ‘Churchill meloncholia’. He gathered from Churchill’s friends that there was a belief that this depressive strain was hereditary, passed down through the Dukes of Marlborough, but hap..."
