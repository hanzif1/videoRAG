I exchanged the bill for $100 singles and went around the city asking 100 New Yorkers for a dollar’s worth of wisdom. The resulting feature was a hit!But then I had a new quandary. Of the 100 New Yorkers I stopped on the street, only 56 had wisdom to offer. And of those, only 36 accepted the money. That left me with $64 to spend. “What,” I asked in the last issue, “should I do with the remainder?”I got a lot of suggestions from readers, both by email and in the comments. Most fell into one of three categories.Some suggested I donate the money. “Find 64 homeless ..."

In that spirit, I have concocted a number of thought experiments.Today: What if everyone had to wear a uniform?I probably need to stipulate up-front that I am the opposite of a clothes horse. I’m clothes-indifferent. Indeed, vestigial from my growing up in the hippie era, I continue to believe that if a person doesn’t like me because I’m not well turned out, screw ‘em.Having acknowledged that bias, I’ll try to don my statesman hat and in today’s thought experiment, muse on the pros and cons of this: What if everyone had to wear a uniform — say, something middle-of-the road like a standard shirt ..."

Boys are doing badly too, but their rates of depression and anxiety are not as high, and their increases since 2011 are smaller. As I showed in my Feb. 16 Substack post, the big surprise in the CDC data is that COVID didn’t have much effect on the overall trends, which just kept marching on as they have since around 2012.

Members • GarouAPM 繁體中文 Seriously: why does Gandalf fall in the Bridge of Khazad-dûm in the movie? Movies Okay, so everyone believes he fell off because the Balrog attached his whip to Gandalf's ankles. But it actually doesn't: if you look closely, the whip detaches in the last moment. Take a look at this picture: https://imgur.com/HvPyeHR It's a bit difficult to notice, but if you look closely, the whip detaches from Gandalf's ankles; it's even more obvious if you search for the scene in YouTube and slow it down.

Are you being held back in any areas of life because you are over-tending to the needs of others? If you have never before read ‘The Bridge’ from Friedman’s Fables, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading this classic short story below. And remember, you are responsible for your own path and no one else’s! THE BRIDGE BY EDWIN FRIEDMAN There was a man who had given much thought to what he wanted from life. He had experienced many moods and trials. He had experimented with different ways of living, and he had had his share of both success ..."

He has the dog lifestyle mastered- he’s fed on a schedule and only eats his favorite foods, he gets the best treats, he has playtime every day, and he knows he can sit almost anywhere in the house and you’ll still love him. With all this in mind, he chooses to sit on your fluffy, soft down pillow covered in a 1,000 thread count pillowcase. He squishes his little butt onto it just right and has now claimed it as his. When you find him, he simply smiles at you with the face, “What? I thought you said we could share.” The Root of the BehaviorJust like humans, dogs like to be comfortable and warm.

Since the introduction of the Canon 5D Mark II DSLR camera, high quality, shallow depth of field footage has become accessible to anybody who can afford a DSLR. Long gone are the days of only being able to achieve that elusive film look with a 35mm film camera. So with this, has the role of the person behind the camera taken a shift? And therefore what we call that person? Shooting on a traditional Broadcast Camera In the past… Lets look back 20-30 years at the role of the Cameraman within the TV and Corporate industries.

It’s about choosing the sure thing over chasing something uncertain. I’ve seen it play out in both life and birdwatching, and it always rings true. This simple phrase holds a big life lesson we can all use. 2 Birds in the Hand You’ve probably heard the saying, “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” I’ve lived this lesson more than once, both in life and literally while birdwatching. The idea is simple: what you have right now is often more valuable than chasing after what you might get. This phrase isn’t just an old proverb—it’s a reminder to appreciate the present before chasing uncertain possibilities.

Although we likely dream every night, we often forget them quickly upon waking, unless we are roused during or shortly after a dream. Dreams can be about all sorts of things and often take on surreal qualities, likely linked to dopamine production in the brain.Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, was the first to formally introdu..."

Instead of building on his historic victory, he completely rebuilt his swing.“No, no,” he told his coach Butch Harmon, “I don’t want incremental change, I want a total remodel.”This might seem like a reckless decision. But Tiger had a hidden advantage that made this audacious move far more calculated than most people realized: winning the Masters had earned him a 10-year exemption on the Tour. Unlike other pros who needed to maintain their performance to keep their Tour cards, Tiger had the luxury of time.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeThe Strategic Risk“It’s common for elite athletes to constantl..."

This week I bring you a dramatic little story which epitomises these challenges.First, let’s set the scene. Today, 29th July, happens to be International Tiger Day, so a tiger-themed story seems apt. At Tobacco Dock in Wapping, East London there’s a statue/sculpture (see below) depicting a boy looking awestruck at a tiger, which has a threateningly raised paw. (I haven’t managed to establish who the artist is or when it was installed, although it was perhaps when the dock was redeveloped as a shopping mall in 1989.)Here’s what the caption under a companion statue of a bear says:Over a hundred years ago o..."

Members • [deleted] Are my baby’s movements (particularly hands) normal? My nine week old (born 5 weeks early) spends a lot of his time stretching and making odd hand movements, especially when he brings his hands to his face. I think I’m looking for some reassurance that this is normal. Does/did your baby behave like this? At the baby group we attend, the other babies don’t seem as stiff when they move.

Step 1: Let the mass of both twins be represented by 'm'. Step 2: The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula KE = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2. Step 3: Let the velocity of Alexa be 'v', then the velocity of Louise is '3v'. Step 4: The kinetic energy of Alexa (KE_Alexa) = 0.5 * m * v^2. Step 5: The kinetic energy of Louise (KE_Louise) = 0.5 * m * (3v)^2 = 0.5 * m * 9v^2 = 4.5 * m * v^2. Step 6: Therefore, the ratio of Louise's kinetic energy to Alexa's kinetic energy is 4.5 : 1.

Let's assume Denver consumes x avocados per year and Phoenix consumes y avocados per year. The difference in consumption is y - x. To express this as a percentage of Denver's consumption, we divide the difference by x and multiply by 100. Percentage difference = (y - x) / x * 100 Since the question asks for the percentage more that Phoenix consumes compared to Denver, we can rearrange the equation to solve for y: y = x + (x * percentage difference / 100) Let's assume the percentage difference is p. y = x + (x * p / 100) Now, we can substitute the given answer choices to find the correct percentage difference. 20%: y = x + (x * 20 / 100) = x + 0.2x = 1.2x 36%: y = x + (x * 36 / 100) = x + 0.36x = 1.36x 40%:..."

Discussion My understanding is, it is etiquette to applaud after a piece is finished, not after movements. I consider the pause in between movements to be part of the music and performance so I try not to distract that. However, everyone claps after each movement, every time I attend a classical music concert. Some would clap whenever there is a pause, and they are not too uncommon! Now I started thinking if the culture is different now from what I remember and it's accepted that..."

This is about how to treat a historic event in its reality versus children’s fiction around a prohibitive topic. It was a risk that John Boyne was taking and he chose to tiptoe on the reality bit and presents the story from a 9-year-old’s perspective.The innocence of the perspective has to be first acknowledged, or else we will be discussing the veracity of the fable, which I would rather not. As a book reviewer, I follow the author than take an independent stand, not because I don’t deplore and condemn the gruesome events at the Auschwitz camp, but because there are enough revelations of the gruesomeness that filter through the innocent and nai..."

I just witnessed a distracted Mom allow her young son ( 5 ish?) to have full control over a shopping cart. He proceeded to knock over a huge display of condiments ( mayo, mustard ketchup) and then start running with the cart and nearly knock over an elderly man, which he would have done if a man didnt step in for the distracted Mom and stop the cart.

I know MANY of you have been asking for a way to make it public (as I read into the wee hours of the day trying to catch up on everything I missed.) Anyways, the Cult of Neo is going public, as I’m posting those guide thread with the guides from the original PM.

Following up on my unhappy encounter with “Little Miss Sunshine,” I took in “Man Push Cart” last Friday night. These are two independent American films that have garnered rave reviews. I guess that when it comes to movies and politics, I obey some kind of strange compulsion to think for myself. “Man Push Cart” sounds like my kind of movie. It is a study of a Pakistani operator of one of those ubiquitous stainless steel coffee and donut carts all over New York, mostly run by recent immigrants from Asia. As someone with a long-standing curiosity about the hidden economic life of this city, I was anxious to see if the film revealed any deep secrets. Unfortunat..."

I’m reading East of Eden by John Steinbeck right now and I wanted to share a passage that struck me, as many have so far. “In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I just choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that out death brings no pleasure to our world.” I, like everyon..."

Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter. Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success.
