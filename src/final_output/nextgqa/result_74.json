The healthcare team should consider the patient's previously expressed wishes, if known, first. This is crucial in respecting the patient's autonomy and ensuring that their wishes are honored, especially in situations where the patient is unable to make decisions for themselves due to advanced Alzheimer's disease. Option a is incorrect because the patient's wishes should be prioritized over the family member with medical power of attorney. Option b is incorrect as financial implications should not take precedence over the patient's wishes.

Why did the turtle cross the road? No, that isn’t the beginning of a joke. Turtles cross the road like they have an important place to go, well they do. Turtles are constantly moving back and forth from different bodies of water, but most turtles you encounter, especially during the months of May and June are female turtles.

Others will have a smaller bucket, meaning that their bucket will be filled much more rapidly - even if they experience the same events as their peers who happen to have larger buckets.Following me so far?

Usually it’s my left foot that ends up sockless, while the sock on my right foot seems perfectly in place. When this happens, I get up and go about my morning routine while walking around the house wearing only one sock because, apparently, it takes too much time to remove the one I’m still wearing. What annoys me most about this scenario is then, when it comes time to make the bed, I end up searching through a sea of blankets until I locate the missing sock. If I can’t locate it within thirty seconds, I give up, make the bed and go about my day only to find a bunch of unpaired socks wrapped up in the sheets on laundry day. First World problems, I know.

At around six or seven months of age, my son would swat at my husband if he tried to touch or kiss me while my son was nursing. By ten months or so, my son would throw a full-on stiff-arm my husband’s way any time he'd try to hug me if he were in my arms, actively pushing us apart.

I’ve been making comics about my life since age 11…when I started keeping a diary in words and pictures. I put entries into that almost every day, for about fifteen years. So when it came time to create my first full-length graphic novel, choosing to write about my own life was a natural decision. Smile is about knocking out my two front teeth just as I was hitting puberty, as well as entering middle school. I had to go through years of orthodontic treatment: braces, headgear, false teeth, and lots of surgeries in order to have a normal-looking smile again. The experience had an enormous impact on me, and years later, I was still th..."

I was with my baby in a very popular outdoor shopping center when a woman and man (presumably her husband) approached me. The woman rushed toward me smiling and started over-the-top gushing about how cute my baby was, stating they had their own little one at home. Okay, extreme reaction, but nothing super weird so far. I politely thanked her. However she then started asking me a series of questions. How old was he? What was his name? Was I staying at home with him or was I on maternity leave?
