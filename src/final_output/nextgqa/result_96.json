Among the key advantages of these post-rail biking routes is the ease with which gradients are managed, thanks to the specific nature of rail transport, where the maximum permissible incline of a railway line is just 3 percent. Meanwhile, depending on their age and fitness level, cyclists may find climbs with inclines of 5-7 percent challenging to conquer. Cyclists also appreciate the fact that these railway biking routes typically meander away from towns and busy roads, fostering a closer connection with the natural environment.

                "detail": "Ever notice how your newborn baby waves their arms around? Why do they do that? Newborn arm movement is erratic, thought to be somewhat involuntary. Scientists have observed that these movements can change in response to the environment (darkness vs light), (water vs air), and if there is resistance placed to the arms the baby will counteract the resistance. This tells us that the movements are not all random. Babies are learning when they are moving their arms around: learning about motor- visual- spacial coordination even from birth. When babies are on their moms chest, and there is pressure/ resistance on their arms they push up (counter the resistance). This facilitates feeding at the breast as it helps them lift their head and smell the breast (movement also shown to be facilitated by odour and the smell of moms milk), and they can move to the breast. Your baby’s arms waving around are helping them learn. ❤️. If you are frustrated by “arms getting in the way” of latching, move the..."

Cats walking nearby and suddenly flopping over on their back with a wriggle called the social roll, but why do they do it? Like all cat postures, there are subtle variations of meaning but whether it’s a human or animal watching them, it’s a friendly, non-aggressive stance demonstrating comfort. Comfort is a key point.

Cats were then believed to by symbols of evil and manifestations of shape-shifting witches, which led to their routine killing. Interestingly, historians now believe it was precisely this killing of cats that contributed to the speed in which the Bubonic plague was able to spread througho..."

It Actually Makes a Big DifferenceBy Emily WeaverUpdated on Aug 1, 2024 at 9:15 PMGetty | Mondadori PortfolioGetty | Mondadori PortfolioIt wasn't until I got into competitive swimming that I understood the true importance of a swimmer's cap.

                "detail": "Educational PSA: You often hear bird rehabilitators or facilities tell people not to drip water into a bird's open mouth. Many baby birds have an automatic reponse to open their mouth, even when they're faced with danger. They open their mouth when a cat has them, they open their mouth when they're scared. Yes, they open their mouth when they're hungry, but they can also open it when they're dying. Any visual movement triggers them to open their mouth for food, it is an innate survival response. An open mouth, however, does NOT mean one should drip water into it. Their anatomy is very different than that of mammals and dripping water into the open mouth of a baby bird is like waterboarding them. The water goes directly into the airway and their lungs. They suffocate slowly with each breath, unable to get enough oxygen. The water then sits in their lungs because birds can't cough it out and gives them a bacterial infection (pneumonia).
