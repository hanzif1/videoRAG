And Newtie does it! 08•09•18 by Maggie Marton Yowling. That’s the only word I can think to describe it. Meowing is close, but it doesn’t have the right edge, the sharpness. Or, maybe it’s more of a mournful holler? Regardless: Every single night without fail for about six weeks now, Newtie yowls. She goes upstairs while we’re downstairs–it’s only ever if we’re on separate levels–and she yowls. Then she picks up a cat toy in her mouth while still vocalizing, carries the cat toy somewhere else, drops it, and yowls some more. As..."

This subreddit is for discussion and questions about the Montessori method. “The child is both a hope and a promise for mankind.” -Maria Montessori Members Online • bdgc Getting up from the weaning table Hi, I have 1 y/o twins who are walking. We introduced a weaning table around 8 months. But since they have been able to walk, they aren’t willing to sit through dinner. They will sit for a time and eat, but then get up and want to run around, returning to the table area for food. I already only feed them at their table, but I’m not sure where to go next. It feels like I have to choose between their individual freedom and their nutritional needs. Any one else navigate this? Read more Share New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a w..."

Sometimes words, however descriptive (even mine!), can’t do them justice. So, I’ve attached a video from one of my classes to this post to visually demonstrate. Please have a look (no actors were hired). I was stunned to learn years ago that once a baby is able to sit securely on her own (usually 8 to 12 months old), she can actually sit down to eat at her own little table.  High chairs are certainly functional and have been around for hundreds of years, but believe it or not, it is easier to feed a baby at a small table.  And babies love the independence — their feet touch the floor, they can sit while hungry, and leave the table as soon..."

Another aspect of weaning that I often talk about is the mealtime environment. Having a positive experience at the table can have a huge impact on our little one’s eating. In this blog, Dr Martha gives her advice on how to set expectations and manage toddler behaviour to help kids enjoy mealtimes. Setting Mealtime Expectations Learning to eat is also about learning social rules and rituals at the table. Little ones and toddlers find it hard to sit at a table as long as adults do. Their stomachs are a lot smaller, and their attention span and focus is a lot shorter. For many 3-5 year olds, sitting in one place for longer than 15-20min can be difficult. Sitting at the table is no different!..."

Members Online • takeaabreath When did your baby start rolling both ways? Skills and Milestones I have a soon-go-be 7 month old daughter and only on rare occasions has she rolled from her belly to her back. Most of the time, she’s rolling from back to belly and then getting mad that she’s on her belly (she’s not a fan of tummy time). She’s had a hard time figuring out how to go both ways. Aside from that, she’s learning how to sit up better each day. She seems to be growing and developing really well. I’m just eager for her to learn how to roll from belly to back because I feel like she will enjoy her floor time a bit more when she does. Read more Share Suggested..."

Parenting of sons 30th November 2015 If anyone had said that a boy would utterly transform my world, my values, my lifestyle, my priorities, my entire self definition, the younger me would have laughed out loud. God gave me two of them who have done just that. I’m from an all girl intellectual family and had so little experience of boy-ness and boy-isms.  I needed to learn about them and how to raise them. There’s a worldwide bestseller called “Raising Boys” by a brilliant psychologist Steve Biddulph. He is one of the world’s most well respected parenting experts and I was lucky enough to meet him last month at the end of his latest UK book tour.

Right now I'm mainly riding my road bike. Generally, I feel comfortable using my right hand to do stuff: eat, take photos... whatever... But when I take my left hand off the handlebars, I start to feel jittery... Taking both hands off, I don't know, I haven't got the hang of it yet. I still feel the fear that somehow I'm going to crash. Lately I've been trying it for a couple seconds here and there, and it isn't so bad... But I'm wondering, what advice do you have for riding with no hands? Does it matter if you're pedaling or not? The bike wants to stay upright, yes, while it's moving? Read more Share..."

Ants have a lot of female workers, a queen, and a relatively small number of drones. Theoretically, humans could be organized with a small number of males, or the other way around, or some other ratio like 40:60, plus a minority of intersex people, but we have virtually an equal chance of a foetus being one or the other. Some animals depend on temperature of the egg for whether they are female or male. Why would that be? Is it just something that virtually all mammals do? Or primates at least. Also, in mammals, the male is larger than the female in all the species I can name off the top ..."

Was the man who tried to help Skye get rid of the curse by killing her and bringing her back to life real or imaginary? If he was real, where did he disappear to when they were in the freezer? Did Skye really kill her mom? If so, was the mom who was shown in the crowd during the final concert scene also imaginary? How did the drug dealer Lewis get infected with the curse before he passed it onto Skye? Is it because he witnessed the guy die who was hit by the car (when Lewis was in the house an..."

Frankel caught my eye. As someone who’s into personal growth, the book resonated with my interest in career development, and its provocative title did the rest. So I bought it, took it home, and ever since I read it I’ve been wanting to find the right words to discuss and write about it. Because well, there is quite a lot to unpack. I say ‘the right words’ because Lois P. Frankel left me with very mixed feelings. I loved it and hated it.

Yet stalwarts of the suburb won’t ever give up trying to improve the lot of ‘The Hood’.Max Towle reports. Down Mardon Road and around Shakespeare Avenue and just beyond the corner of Keats Crescent, in a white weatherboard house, Annie Williams sits at her kitchen table having a smoke. From her window she has a perfect view of her street. This morning, she is distracted by a puppy that has escaped her neighbours’ backyard via the underside of their house and is ambling along the tarmac. She tells her grandson, Arctic, to go over and shepherd the dog back and pile up punga so it can’t escape again, but it does. She drops her ash in a small glass dish. There are artefacts and shells on the windowsill and pots and pans in the sink. Behind the door is flax and taonga from a Māori craft store she ran a generation ago.

Later on, I read many answers on why they can’t live nearby a waterfall, and I’m just not convinced. I thought maybe “they should just live nearby a waterfall” is too simplistic and there are more complex reasons why they c..."

Difference to the wall is 0,4m. I’m sitting on the lounchair, in the mid between the speaker. Couch is against the wall. I can fold up the backleans. in this position there is no real sense of space, no deep stage. can also place the loudspeaker further to the right at 2.9m. then I get a better stage, but sit on the couch not realy good. The sound in both positions is always shifted to the right. think that is due to the window on the left.

LO is very interested and tasted everything I offered. The thing is, even if I try to give food in the air, LO goes mouth first and sucks on that, the hands chilling on the table. When LO takes a break I try to give it in the hand, sometimes it works, but sometimes for slippery foods (nectarine for instance with skin) LO gets frustrated and drops it. Is it ok like this sometimes? I also leave it on the table but LO struggles picking it up and even so, the way to the mouth is complicated. It han..."

Sometimes words, however descriptive (even mine!), can’t do them justice. So, I’ve attached a video from one of my classes to this post to visually demonstrate. Please have a look (no actors were hired). I was stunned to learn years ago that once a baby is able to sit securely on her own (usually 8 to 12 months old), she can actually sit down to eat at her own little table.  High chairs are certainly functional and have been around for hundreds of years, but believe it or not, it is easier to feed a baby at a small table.  And babies love the independence — their feet touch the floor, they can sit while hungry, and leave the table as soon..."

The sign she uses most is “more.”When I was pregnant with my son, I took slow, blood-circulating walks around Prospect Park and thought about feeding him lemons. Not just lemons, of course. Also roast chicken and broccoli florets, their edges nicely charred from the oven; sweet, juicy peaches and tart Cortland apples; curried egg salad and garlicky Greek yogurt whipped with olive oil; fat, unctuous sardines and crispy schnitzel served with silky mashed potatoes, peppery arugula, and August tomatoes.

So everytime someone asks for a really good or terrifying story this one comes out, but I read it and I don’t know why I couldn’t quite grasp it. I’m not saying it’s a bad story nor anything I’m fairly sure I lost something while reading it. I didn’t understand what was the point, who was she, why her mom was like that?

Woodstein Aug 23, 2016 On weekday mornings, my 22-month-old daughter comes with me to my office. She reads books, plays with toys, and breastfeeds while I do some work. Then we walk over to her nursery, which is on my university campus. It didn’t occur to me that we walked slowly to the nursery until people began pointing it out. As we walk there, we often run into my colleagues or other people I know from work. A number of them have made comments about what a long, slow journey my daughter and I are making, or have asked if it’s boring or frustrating for me to go..."

And if you are a mom, you might know this to be true. The slowing down starts with your swollen belly, duck-waddle walk, sleep deprivation from peeing in the middle of the night every hour and a half like clockwork and things like heartburn, shortness of breath, and calves that seem to have swallowed ankles whole. It continues with a labor and delivery that rarely goes as planned. And no matter how that baby comes into this world, it leaves a warrior’s mark on your body.

TED is the copyright owner of this talk and the original video is featured above. Speech Transcript I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call “the danger of the single story.” I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories..."

TED is the copyright owner of this talk and the original video is featured above. Speech Transcript I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call “the danger of the single story.” I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories..."

Or, maybe it’s more of a mournful holler? Regardless: Every single night without fail for about six weeks now, Newtie yowls. She goes upstairs while we’re downstairs–it’s only ever if we’re on separate levels–and she yowls.

Peaches are perfectly ripe, apricots are plump, and berries are bursting with flavor. Even if you’re not a year round fruit-i-vore, summer makes you want to be one. In every client nutrition session, I hear about what people eat. At minimum, I have them recall what they’ve eaten in the past 24 hours. At most, I have 2 weeks of written record.
