I’m the type of person who packs an umbrella even at the slightest possibility of rain – in fact, at school my friends found it amusing how I always seemed to have an umbrella even in the middle of summer. Lately though, I’d begun relying on a new weather app that provided very reliable hour-by-hour rain predictions to figure out what to wear in the morning – a sort of just-in-time clothing process – and today it told me the probability of rain was very low, hence no umbrella. And so here I was, sheltering underneath an awning waiting for the pedestrian lights to turn green, speaking to a guy who’d just been standing there. I hadn’t noticed him at first; I was listening to a podcast of This American Life, the one about Father’s Day, and it took a whil..."

When I was 12 I received an orange and yellow fine georgette silk scarf, from an adult American family friend, for Christmas.Â  At the time I thought it was pretty but a really weird gift to give a kid.Â  As a self conscious 12 year old there was no way I was going to wear that scarf, but strangely, I have kept it to this day. Even then I could appreciate the quality and beauty of the piece.Â  Little did I know that this little scarf would turn me into a scarf collector; not systematically, like many collectors, but rather from a simple fundamental attraction when I see one that speaks to me. I collect different colours of pashminas, and vintage travel scarv..."

Israel doesn’t have a king yet.  Instead their leader is called a “judge,” which is where we get the title of this book.   The “judges” are the charismatic leaders that God calls to help deliver the Israelites from these neighboring communities and lead them in faithful ..."

I BLACKWATER PARK, HAMPSHIRE. June 11th, 1850. — Six months to look back on — six long, lonely months since Laura and I last saw each other! How many days have I still to wait? Only one! To-morrow, the twelfth, the travellers return to England. I can hardly realise my own happiness — I can hardly believe that the next four-and-twenty hours will complete the last day of separation between Laura and me. She and her husband have been in Italy all the winter, and afterwards in the Tyrol. They come back, accompanied by Count Fosco and his wife, who propose to settle somewhere in the neighbourhood of London, and who have engaged to stay at Blackwater Park for the summer months before deciding on a place of residence.

When you take a pregnancy test, the control line shows that the test is working, and the test line shows the results. If a second line appears (pink or blue) – even a faint one – the test has detected the pregnancy hormone in your urine. See your healthcare provider to confirm you are pregnant. Sometimes people confuse other lines on pregnancy tests for a positive result. The important thing to look for is a second line that develops color. A shadowy, shiny, colorless mark on a pregnancy test is not a positive. If you’re ever unsure of your pregnancy test result, repeat using another test, or see your doctor. How Does a Pregnancy Test Work? For a quick primer, at-home pregnancy tests check your urine for Human Chorionic Gonadotropin hormone, or hCG, wh..."

I’m talking about fetch and it’s not all it’s cracked up to be! Playing fetch with your dog can place a lot of stain on their body and is also a leading cause of many of the injuries I see walk or, more accurately, limp through my doors.  In this week’s blog I take a look at the game of fetch and explain why it’s something you should think twice about before..."

Birds falling from the sky… end of the world? Apparently there is a video going around showing birds just dropping out of the sky… and people are freaking out! So, is the world about to end? Here is the video that is going around. Ok, so the Bible does actually mention birds in relation to the end of the times, believe it or not. Just to list some of those instances you can look at the following passages: Ezekiel 38:20, Hosea 4, Zephaniah 1:3, and Revelation 19:21. Let’s take a quick look at each one just to see what they are talking about, and see if birds dropping dead is a sign of the end of the world.

If your director/animation supervisor/lead tells you do something that contradicts this, do that.] Bird flight is notoriously hard to animate convincingly, and there are many reasons for this. The action is very fast, but even in slow motion it is often hard to understand what's happening underneath because the bones are concealed by feathers, plus the movement is completely alien to us, it's not something we can act out or get a feel for. When investigated thoroughly, many things about flight seem odd, even counterintuitive. Over the years I've animated quite a few birds and have slowly gained a rudimentary knowledge of the dynamics and biomechanics of flight, as well as how to apply some of the traditional animation tricks to it. So, here are my..."

We hardly pay any attention to them most of the time. When we do notice them, we watch them flap their wings and then instantly they are flying through the air. The flapping is so fast that we can't really see what they're doing. Well, it turns out that birds are performing some seriously complicated motion with their wings in order to get into the air. If we could observe this complicated wing motion then we'd see just now amazing birds and their gift of flight are. I posted a slow motion video of birds at the end of this article. The problem is that our eyes aren't designed to see things that move really fast. For example, one second a balloon is there and the next second it is gone after you stick a pin in it.
