Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people, have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts. In Europe and ..."

Throughout modern history, revolutions in transport have not just altered mobility or the geography of places; they have been absolutely necessary for the economic, political and historical development of whole countries. Railways, for example, due to its ability to connect remote areas rapidly, succeeded in speeding up not only the commercial and migration flows of Western countries on the 19th Century; they also speeded up the collapse of pre-capitalist social formations, fostering modern national cohesion and helpi..."

This is often said when someone is hit in the head during a sporting event. But this type of injury should never be taken lightly. A concussion can occur when a person has a trauma such as a blow to the head or the head being shaken. In fact, concussions can happen whether the person is actually “knocked out” (loses consciousness) or not. Concussions are a common issue among school aged children and teenagers, especially if they are active in sports. In the United States alone, more than 300,000 concussions occur per year as a result of sports. An athlete who plays a contact sport, such as football, wrestling, basketball or soccer, is estimated to have a 19 percent chan..."

Members Online • dragonscale76 [TOMT][TVSHOW] One of the characters- a woman- has a condition that makes her walk backward Solved This is the only part of this show that sticks out for me and I can't remember any other major details about the show. Pretty sure it was on for only one season- I think after 2010. There was a pretty famous lead and it was kind of funny. They were trying to solve something, maybe...? I wish I could remember more about who was in it. I thought that the character was played by Sheryl Underwood, but I can't find it in her IMDB profile, so probably not her. Read more Locked post.

For example, your baby looks closely at objects, bangs blocks together, looks for things that they’ve dropped, and tries to find toys after seeing them hidden. Your baby still puts most things into their mouth too.Your baby is getting a lot of practice at picking up things. And by around 7 months, your baby will have well-coordinated eye-hand movements. This means they can use their fingers to catch and drag objects towards them.Crawling, rolling or shuffling are all ways your baby might be moving around. Your baby can sit on their own and might also pull themselves up onto their knees or even onto their feet to stand.At this age, your baby love..."

Disclaimer: This is an anonymous forum so answers may not be correct Members Online • stdoubtloud Why do some women have more hip movement when walking than others? I've noticed that women's walking styles can vary significantly. Some women have a very pronounced side-to-side hip movement when they walk, while others have almost none, regardless of body type or figure. Is this difference in walking gait something natural/anatomical (like differences in hip structure, pelvis width, leg length, or center of gravity), or is it something learned/cultural? Or maybe a combination of both? I'm genuinely curious about the biomechanics and factors that influence these different walking styles. Read more Archived post. New c..."

LONDON: Here’s a tip for men — it’s a woman’s sway as she walks which shows that she is ready for love, says a new study.

If you haven’t read my review, it’s here. First of all, what’s in a name? Kneale changed the name of his hero from Kipps to Kidd, apparently because writer Susan Hill took Kipps’ name from an HG Wells story. The name of the woman in black has also changed. In the book she is Jennet Humfrye; in the film her surname is now Goss, though I keep seeing people claiming her first name is still Jennet. I’m not so sure; her name is pronounced Janet in the 1989 film, and when Ar..."

I saw the film a matter of hours ago and this is my first impression of it. Inevitably I couldn’t help making comparisons with the TV film and book – hard as I tried to push them from my mind. It was clear, however, from the outset that this was a very different beast. For me, Woman in Black is a provincial tale. Everything about it is understated – it is the creeping horror, captured in both the book and the TV film that single it out and, in a way, contribute to its effectiveness.

Give me a haunted house, a graveyard and a black-clad figure loitering in the middle-distance, and I am jelly. The 1989 TV film of The Woman in Black made me scared to go to bed. The theatre version gave me goose-pimples. In fact, here is the first part of a two-part list of some of the films that freaked me out. And yet the 2012 version of The Woman in Black left me completely unscared, unscarred, unafraid. But how can this be? What went wrong? Let me get this out of the way: I’m glad the film has done well, for Hammer’s sake, and the same way I’m glad when any spooky film or book does well, thus contradicting my literary agent when in 2005 he told me there was no market for h..."

Speculation false The physics behind the rope tension towards the end didn't seem fair as I watched. Please compare the scenes with Hae Min pulling at 01:18:10 compared with Woo Jin at 01:17:34 & 01:18:18. The way Hae Min pulled at the rope with his entire body yet the rope not even moving was highly sus to me when I was watching.

I just took my kids to see an 85th anniversary showing of The Wizard of Oz, and one part of the film really stuck out: the lollipop guild. To recap, Dorothy's house lands in Munchkin land, crushing the wicked witch who had been oppressing the Munchkins. After confirming the witch's death, the Munchkins welcome Dorothy as a hero. We get a speech from the mayor, and a welcome from the lullaby league, who are dressed as ballerinas ..."
