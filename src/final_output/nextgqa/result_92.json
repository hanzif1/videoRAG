I mean you have a baby how can you resist right?

Your baby can see, hear, experience, taste, and on a primitive level, learn in utero. Most importantly they can feel, not with an adults sophistication, but feel nonetheless! repost @babies_and_beyond A bond is born, and life takes on a whole new meaning.

First, my mother made me as a boy child and brought me into this world. She sent me off to play and to learn lessons about this thing we call life. Second, there was the woman who made me a man. For the price of my virginity, she gave me entry into the adult world of sex. I remain forever grateful to both women — the first time I came out of a vagina and the second time I came in one.As teens we like to imagine how we’ll lose our virginity. I was ambitious, imagining multiple orgasms. Sometimes I imagined multiple partners. Remember, teenage boy. But despite my Prince-inspired lavender lust, and for reasons th..."

But in my early 20s, I believed it when people told me that anything was possible with hard work and determination. I actually thought life worked like a shmaltzy motivational poster--the type you see in car dealerships behind the desk of that slick salesman who used to run track and now spends his days trying to upsell people on heated seats. Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you’ve imagined! I didn’t finish my first book by the time I was 25.

Many times I really enjoy showing them a single key to press and I play some chords that match with that key and the little children usually wait for me to point to the next key for them to play.

The lack of an Apollo 11 flag is consistent with astronaut Buzz Aldrin's memory of the famous mission. Aldrin said the flag blew over from the rocket blast when astronauts left the surface.

She went to Juilliard while she was still in high school, and she would have been a concert pianist if women had done that sort of thing in those days. She was that good.

It's not a ritual of confusion — it's one of deep respect. The Western Wall is the last remaining piece of the ancient Temple, a place layered with centuries of prayers and devotion. Out of honor, people avoid turning their backs on it. Instead, they walk away backwards, holding on to the reverence a little longer. A small act, but one that carries a world of meaning. Have you ever experienced this tradition or visited the Wall?

They are making the audience feel nervous, and anticipating the rest of the film. At the start of the opening scene there is an extreme close up of a little pretending to tip tea into a cup and then a switch to another extreme close up of the girl giving it to the doll.
