August 15, 2023August 15, 2023 / The Science Dog The Joy of a Well-Thrown Ball It is summertime and pool season is in full swing at our house. This means daily swimming and retrieving for our dogs. They love nothing better than an afternoon at the pool with friends and lots (and lots) of toy-throwing into the water. (Our dogs seem to view human friends who come to the pool as bodies with throwing arms attached). COOPER APPRECIATING A WELL-THROWN BALL Ball-Throwing Competency We have noticed over the years that visitors vary considerably in their, should we say, “ball-throwing talents”. Some nail it every single time, with the ball landing in the middle of the pool, well positioned for the perfect leap, swim and grab. Others, well…..not so much. We have..."

By talizman Date 03.06.04 23:09 UTC A bit of training advice please........My 13 month old GSD is a tad possessive with his ball.I am happy with most aspects of his training; sit, stay, paw, down etc etc, however, when I throw his ball for him, he fetches and comes back to me but won't drop it!He tries to entice you into a tug of war which obviously is more fun for him that the retrieving aspect!You have to actually wrench the ball from him in order to throw it again.I've used treats to entice him to drop the ball, which work to an extent, but he always tries to snatch the ball as you reach for it.Is this possesiveness a dominance thing? Any ideas how I can make him drop the ball and wait for me to pick it u..."

Topics EnergyEngineering Activity Type Exploration Language English Print In this activity, students will play with cars to discover how potential and kinetic energy make them move. Toy cars use a variety of mechanisms to make them go, but they all store up potential energy. Although the elastic material inside is usually steel and not rubber, the principle is the same. By changing the shape of the material (usually a coil of metal) energy is stored and then released as motion. Objectives Explain how stored potential energy can be transferred into kinetic energy. Materials Per Class or Group: several types of toy cars (e.g. rat trap cars, fly wheel cars, wind-up cars) ramps Key Questions What types of energy does each car use to move? What is different about each car?What mechanism does each car use? How does each car store potential energy? Which car goes the farthest? What is the most effective type of c..."
