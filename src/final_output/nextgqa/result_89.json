Subscribe to the DocUnlock YouTube Channel to be notified when we release a new video!—TranscriptRegardless of culture, the sway of the hips is associated with beauty and femininity. If you look closely at the woman in the yellow dress, you’ll see that the when her right foot leads forward her right hip appears to rise and swing outward. As her right foot moves behind her, her right hip moves down and swings in slightly.So why do women walk this way? It boils down to some key differences between male and female anatomy.Male VS Female PelvisA key difference between the skeleton of men and women is the pelvic bone. The female pelvis tends to be wider and shorter than the male pelvis. It needs to be this way because women’s hips need accommodate something totally crazy: pregnancy.The female pelvis needs to accommodate a baby that weighs 3.5 kilograms on average and be a..."

Members • TheLateGreatMe What leads us to believe that time is moving in only one direction? It's occurred to me that all our perspective on the passage of time is based on our memories. That is to say there has been a change between something we had known in the past and the present we now inhabit.The problem with this is all of it is biochemically based. If time were really running in reverse (from the end of time all the way back to the big bang), and you could stop at any point and ask a human if it was going in reverse, they would most likely say \"no, because things I remember in the past are different than they are today.\" Even something more absolute such as the expansion of the universe, increase in..."

Camille Doncieux was born in 1846 and met the impoverished but talented painter, Claude Monet, for the first time in 18..."

The first reaction to the painting is that she is pregnant. Not so, if you look carefully she is holding an enormous amount of fabric up against herself, thus showing the status and wealth in her clothing. It is also the style of the day. Jan Van Eyck used the same style of dress in several of his paintings.A detail from Jan van Eyck's Dresden Triptych showing St. Catherine - note the way a large swath of fabric is held firmly above the book she is reading, and how she looks pregnant due to the style of dress.The couple are identified as Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini and his wife Jeanne Cenami.

For instance, just because your cat got along with your previous dogs, that doesn't mean the cat will like all dogs. So always use caution and proceed slowly when introducing your cat to a new dog (or your dog to a new cat).If you have multiple cats or dogs, it’s best to introduce them only one at a time. Have at least two people present — one to handle the dog’s leash and the other to tend to the cat.  In the initia..."
