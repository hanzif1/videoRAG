On Sunday 5 July 2020 there was a Poetry of the Lockdown event as part of Ledbury Poetry Festival Online.  The event featured a fascinating selection of Lockdown inspired poems, including poets commissioned by LPF, Naomi Shihab Nye, Sarala Estruch, Suzannah Evans, Elaine Beckett and Kim Moore.

Brown skinned, white haired and with a bit of stubble, sporting a narrow-brimmed hat and dark clothing – even wearing a jacket in a London summer heatwave – he sits on a black roller-bag suitcase. It holds him up, so I imagine it’s full enough of clothing and other needed items to clothe him for a bit.But I wonder, is that all he has? The small paper cup placed in front of him reveals he is not just doing this for fun, although it’s clear the accordion is his cherished companion.

It’s excellent preparation for the stage. It allows you to test your presence, your original compositions, your style, and many other aspects. If you manage to capture the attention of passersby, you’ll likely be able to perform on larger stages. It’s also a great way to rehearse and improve. People who stop won’t really judge you, as they’re taking advantage of the opportunity you’re giving them to listen. If they don’t like your music, they’ll walk away and continue on their way. On the other hand, if they enjoy your style, they’ll leave you some coins and bills, chat with you, etc. This is where your first artist-audience relationship..."

However a normal dog can have a wet, cool nose one moment and then when next noticed it may be warm and dry. A wet nose helps absorb scent chemicals which enhance a dog’s already very well developed sense of smell. Because dogs don’t have sweat glands like people a wet nose also helps to cool them down.  Remember a moist nose is normal but a runny nose is not, especially if accompanied by a cough or sneezing. If you not sure give us a call and our nurses or vets can advice you if a check-up seems best. DevAccount2019-10-31T22:29:07+10:..."

These little videos that he prepares are not the kind of thing that would be of interest to anybody outside our family, but I eagerly await their appearance, as I am not able to see the two boys very often. Sometimes I notice something in the clip that makes me think, \"Gee, little Alex behaves just like his mother did when she was that age,\" but I have no actual way to confirm that, because when his mother was that age, we had no video camera. When my children were young, video cameras were still very expensive, and nowhere near as ubiquitous as they have since become.

I’ve read online that babies can start holding their own bottle around 6 months or beyond, but I’m wondering if this was true for those who exclusively pumped and therefore who used bottles early and often. If your baby is older, when did they start holding their own bottle? When did they start truly being able to feed themselves, if different?

                "detail": "Bateman Reviews: THE MEN IN WHITE REVIEW Bateman Reviews Monday, October 22, 2018 THE MEN IN WHITE REVIEW The current production of THE MEN IN WHITE at Factory Theatre holds the promise of a play that could provide powerful cultural reflection in the face of great turmoil. But much like the clash of politics and religion in both countries where the action occurs, that promise is divided and corrupted in complex and tragic ways. Unfortunately these divisions manifest themselves in a theatrically compromised manner onstage that may have more to do with production values than dramaturgy. Anosh Irani’s script is a well constructed interplay between two disparate worlds that share similar dreams within vastly different environments. Irani’s intense dramedy moves from fast paced romantic misconception to intense religious and social conflict. Components of the stage setting give the overall scenic tension a kind of IKEA cabinet look that perhaps unconsciously downplays the raw setting of the..."

It deals with the gamut of issues that face immigrants to Canada but that is only a small part of what the play offers. It is funny, moving and intelligent with a fine plot and well-developed characters. And at the end it delivers a punch that stuns you. The title is ironic. The men in white may wear white but they are not white at all. They are mostly immigrants from India who play cricket in Vancouver. That is one half of the play. The other half takes place in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood of Mumbai (Bombay), India in a chicken slaughterhouse. Huse Madhavji, Tahirih Vejdani and Chanakya Mukherjee.

And Newtie does it! 08•09•18 by Maggie Marton Yowling. That’s the only word I can think to describe it. Meowing is close, but it doesn’t have the right edge, the sharpness.

Eating, you can hold off for a few days, pooping is optional (for a while anyway), but peeing is right up there with breathing on the list of things you just gotta do each and every day. So when something happens to stem the flow of pee, trouble ensues - and fast. Pee is a funny little substance. It actually has lots of good stuff in it.

Photo by Marsha Dhita on UnsplashThere’s a notion I run into quite frequently in trans inclusive spaces, which holds that trans men are just different from cis men in a fundamental way.Cis men cannot possibly relate to the vulnerabilities and insecurities that trans men face, according to this argument, because they’ve never experienced gender minority status. And because trans men have been impacted by both transphobia and misogyny throughout their lives, they understand the gender-marginalized experience in ways than no cis man ever could.
