They help to keep your bladder, uterus, vagina and bowel (pelvic organs) in the right place. Your pelvic floor muscles should be kept strong and active, just like any other muscle. All bladder and bowel functions need good pelvic floor muscles. For example, when you need to go to the toilet, you use your pelvic floor muscles to prevent any leaks. Then, you will fully relax them to pass urine when you physically get to the toilet. Strong pelvic floor muscles boost your core strength and stability. They can improve your sexual function too.

However, the recent influx of unnecessary and childish emojis (, etc.) has become extremely distracting and frustrating. This emoji flood makes conversations feel dumbed down to the level of a 5-10-year-old’s chat, which is completely inappropriate for serious and meaningful discussions. It undermines the AI’s credibility and disrupts the flow of communication. Please remove this feature or at least give users the option to disable it manually. It adds no real value and only makes interactions unnecessarily cluttered and annoying. Unfortunately, neither I nor ChatGPT can turn off this irritating emoji overload...."

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.

New to Cats/Just Adopted I'm a bit of a germophobe so I know I'm gonna have to make some sacrifices when it comes to having a cat who goes everywhere. But whenever you touch your cat, do you wash your hands? She follows me everywhere so I can't help but pet her especially while I'm sitting at my desk for hours. I don't wanna get bacteria all over my keyboard or anything, but unless I ignore her, I can't be bothered to get up and wash my hands every time.

An old cat slept all day on the stone step in the sun, and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away in her chair at the open window, till, some one happened to knock on one of the green tables. She had milk and cream cheese to sell, and bread and butter. There was no one who could make such excellent coffee or fry a chicken so golden brown as she. The place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion, and so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of pleasure and dissipation. Edna had discovered it accidentally one day when the high-board gate stood ajar. She caught sight of a little green table, blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the quivering leaves overhead. Within she had found the slumbering mulatresse, the drowsy cat, and a ..."

It’s when children get upset around people they don’t know.Separation anxiety and fear of strangers make sense from a survival point of view.

Members Online • pinoy_grigio_ Can we talk about the tent propped up right in the front middle of Lands End… I don’t recall that being there. It’s such a visual blockade… And it wouldn’t be such an issue if there wasn’t a top. The space is great for VIP or whoever but the tent is 1) in the way and 2) not necessary bc it’s not like super sunny anyway. Usually main stages of festivals are the best visually but that in the middle is throwing me off a bit… I love the sets, but wish that tent wasn’t blocking the middle screen.

You try to find an uncluttered part of your office, create your own makeshift set, or maybe you go out of the building entirely to film on location in a nearby park. That’s because you know instinctively that the background, or setting, of your video makes an impact on the viewer. It’s why there are Academy awards for Production Design, and why if you choose poorly for your own video background, it could result in a poor performing video. So how do you know what setting to choose for your video? Part of it depends on what type of video you are creating. For example, you migh..."

His overtime rate is 1.5 times his standard rate. Therefore, his overtime pay rate is: £13.30 × 1.5 = £19.95 per hour Step 2: **Calculate Simon's total overtime pay.** Simon worked 17 hours of overtime. To find his total overtime pay, we multiply his overtime hourly rate by the number of overtime hours: £19.95 × 17 = £339.15 Step 3: **Round the total pay to the nearest pound.** The total overtime pay is £339.15.

Let's listen together and find out! #thetwofriends Members Online • CleanSlate-13 Tiếng Việt Can we talk about THAT scene from ‘Sinners’? false I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing and having seen no trailers. I knew Ryan Coogler and Michael B and that’s all I needed to know. So happy because absolutely nothing -not even the premise- was spoiled, which made the film so much more of an enjoyable surprise of a ride! But I need to talk about that ONE scene in the juke joint. Oh my god. It’s one of those moments of cinema I will never forget. Saw it in IMAX,..."

I’ve written a blog before all about cutlery tips for babies and toddlers, but in this blog I want to share a bit more about HOW to encourage self-feeding skills in little ones. I’ll also cover some of the most common scenarios that I’m often asked about when it comes to babies feeding themselves. When should babies self-feed? Something many parents want to know is “WHEN do babies learn to feed themselves with a spoon?” The answer, as with everything baby-related, is that there isn’t an exact age when babies and toddlers “should” be able to self-feed competently. All babies develop at different rates, and this applies to feeding skills as well. Having said that, there are rough timelines when babies may start to show c..."

He chucks a rod in, I'm not real interested and happy to sit in a decky and drink beer and banter. He goes off for a piss, next minute the rod bends over. I step in and reel in a thumper. It was the only fish caught for the day to which I claim I caught it. He on the other hand claims he bought the rod, baited it, cast it, basically did everything except reel it in so he is claiming the catch. We aren't arguing over who gets the fish, I don't even want to touch it, just the moral victory. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and vote..."

And they will keep playing this game as long as it’s effective. Unfortunately, for many kids, it’s the only game they know. I’ve worked with many parents over the years who routinely gave in wh..."

Last place I lived was on the 5th floor, and I took stairs up every day, but I always got winded as soon as I ever did. I mentioned this to a friend and she pointed out that it's because I'm only spending a couple of minutes on it at a time. In general, how long should I aim to be climbing stairs to actually improve?

Studies show that many individuals worldwide identify as polyamorous, meaning they partake in a romantic relationship with or feel attracted to more than one individual at a time. In the study, the researchers found that one out of 6 individuals desired a non-monogamous relationship, and one in 15 had already consensually engaged in polyamory. Being in love with two people may not mean you desire to be in multiple romantic relationships or want to try non-monogamy. However, polyamory can be an option if all parties consent and are open to the dynamic. In some cases, being in love with two people may cause relationship conflicts,..."
