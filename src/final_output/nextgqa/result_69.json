Wight looks at how cultures define our views of machines. The word ‘robot’ first appeared in Karel Čapek’s 1921 play, Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti – Rossum’s Universal Robots.

Our Chinese neighbors would often comment on how romantic Western people are, because even though they are already in their sixties, my in-laws still hold each other's hands when they walk.

And in many places, women still hold second-tier status. Unfortunately, that’s just as true in the church as it is in the corporate boardroom. I don’t know much about business, but I am invested in the church. It pains me to say that, for far too long, I was perfectly fine with the gender inequality I found under the steeple. In many ways, I even saw it as directly benefiting me, so why fight it? I grew up in the conservative south. I’ve been a part of the church since I was a fetus. I came to age with an understanding that, while God loved all his children, the guys were extra special. They were given the leadership roles in the church. They were allowed to spea..."

During the winter of  2010, we decided to visit this place despite it was a 11-hours drive away from Karlskrona. The good news was: There were so many Singaporeans (over 40 of us) who were fearless of the minus 25 degrees Celsius weather and were fanatical about trying out skiing while we had the chance. Thus, we decided to book a bus to take all of us there, which was a smart choice because the husbands could avoid the torment of driving half a day on slippery, snow-filled roads and the wives had someone to help relief them of looking after a cranky baby on the gruelling journey.

We stand on a high mountain. Its sloping surface stretches from our feet all the way to the ground, and the sun gazes into the slope like in a mirror. Near us is a small sled, its seat upholstered with bright red cloth. “Let’s slide down, Nadezhda Petrovna!” I implore. “Just one time! I assure you that we will be safe and sound.” But Nadenka is scared. The whole expanse from the tips of her small boots to the foot of the icy mountain seems to her a frightening, immeasurably deep chasm. As she looks down, her insides are paralyzed and her breath stops in her throat – and that’s when I only suggest we sit down in the sled! What w..."

The begging/praying motion is one of the most unusual feline behaviors, but what does it mean, and why do some cats do it? Readers of this blog know I love my cat dearly, but he’s also very weird. Perhaps his strangest, most mysterious behavior is what I call his “praying” gesture: Buddy sits up on his hind legs, puts his front paws together and raises them up and down as if in fervent  prayer. The behavior is extremely rare. Out of many millions of cat videos hosted on the internet, only a handful show cats engaging in it. Here’s Buddy demonstrating his “prayer” form, set to De La Soul’s 1989 track, “Buddy”: It’s seemingly random and impossible to predict, which is why it’s been ..."

I think that’s an apt title as Anne Beddingfield, one of the two narrators of this book, longs for adventure, enjoying the cinema films of The Perils of Pauline. Agatha Christie, though thought it was ‘as silly a title as I had ever heard‘. But as The Evening News were prepared t..."

I’ll be honest – it’s not one of her best. It’s another of her ‘thrillers’ (not necessarily a bad thing in itself, of course).
