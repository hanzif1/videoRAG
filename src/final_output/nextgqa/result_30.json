It's implied the Night King was turning them in to white walkers, but he's turning babies and the only white walkers we see are adults.

The simplest explanation is they're magicked in to adulthood then don't age, but that's less fun to imagine. Note: I'm using \"white walker\" as term for the generals / white walkers who se..."

The microphone uses the chamber and spring for additional reverberation of the child's voice, creating an extended echo. What age group is the toy designed for? This toy is designed for children 3 and older. Psychologists suggest increased dramatic play - which includes musical play - is highly beneficial for children ages 2-4. How does the toy work? How do children play with the toy? The child can sing or talk into the curved end and the spring and microphone chamber mimic the voice-bouncing effect of a regular microphone and amplifier. Children can participate in cooperative play with this toy either by performing for each other or all singing for a separate audience. They are able to listen to themselves, watch others, and hold the microphone. Where did the idea for your toy come from? The idea came from an existing toy I had growing up. I was always fascinated with naturally occurin..."

The Science of Smiling Oct 31, 2022 According to research, the average woman smiles approximately 62 times per day, while the average man only smiles about eight times per day. That’s right; when it comes to smiling,  men are a whopping seven times less likely to smile than women. So why is it that women smile more often than men? Is it because they’re happy all the time? The Reasons There are several reasons for this gender discrepancy, but one of the most important is muscle mechanics. The Brain Controls the Muscles Used in Smiling A special area called Brodmann’s Area 44 (or BA44) is responsible for controlling facial movements, including those that produce smiles and laughter. This part of the brain is larger in women than men, which may ex..."

It argues that women smile too much and should smile less. More than fifteen years later, I'm still receiving checks from an academic press that tells me this essay \"teaches well\" in first-year college writing classes. It is every writer's dream to have a little money maker like this churning out there. Unfortunately, I now feel that though I knocked myself out researching this fascinating topic, a whole chunk of my premise is misguided and incorrect. I still want you to read it though. In what follows, I argue that women smile more than men because they're insecure and want to be liked. I also say that if you put on a happy face when you're unhappy, that fake smile doesn't do anything good for you. For my research at the time, I interviewed noted psychologist and facial expression expert Paul Ekman. I remember that when the piece was published, Ekman didn't seem so thrill..."

Instead of throwing his mask in the grave, Jacket throws his tape recorder in.
