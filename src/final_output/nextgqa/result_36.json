It’s not like startle reflux where their hands shoot up- it’s their normal state. Just when awake, laying on back with hands out in front of them raised and/or flailing around like they’re reaching for something. Been doing this pretty much since born and now 10 weeks. Never thought anything of it until recently and saw another kid of similar age with much more relaxed arms when lying on back. She is otherwise hitting all milestones on time or ahead of schedule.

Discussion Around 8:45 pm this evening (3/11/21), I was driving down I94 passing Battle Creek, MI, when an incredibly bright light dropped from the sky. When the light first caught my eye, it appeared to be a shooting star. Within a matter of seconds, it fell past the telephone tower and disappeared in the tree line. While I did not have any passengers in my car to witness this, I am certain there were others who saw this light falling from the sky because by the time it disappeared. Traffic slowed significantly and the truck driver I passed shortly after w..."

Members • bl4ckcorvus Can anyone please explain these flashes of light I've been seeing up in the night sky as of late? I like to look up at the sky at night and check out the constellations. Lately I've been seeing these flashes of light up in the sky almost like a camera flash but from far away. One night, at around 2AM, I woke up and took my dog out to do his business, and I saw three of these flashes almost simultaneously. These were a lot brighter than the other flashes I've seen, they're mostly kind of dim but bright enough to catch my attention.

Members • IAmClamps Tiếng Việt What is this bright light that slowly faded as it went across the sky above me? This was last night just after 8:00pm MT in the desert outside of Alma, New Mexico. We saw tons of satellites, but this was much brighter and seemed to be lower. It moved slowly and started to fade just as I grabbed my phone to record. The distortion you see around it in the video was accurate to what I saw with my eyes too. Almost like it was obscured by a cloud, but it was a clear night.

The videos themselves were very expressively edited, which made him look and move as if he were a cartoon and not a real person. I think the video was in black and white. Found! I remember that one of the videos was dedicated to some changes in Adobe, but for the life of me I can’t remember what exactly it was. I only remember that the program was jokingly shown as a “girl” break up with a blogger. PS Sorry, English is not my native language and may sound strange ( Read more Archived post.

The grip is the most important part of playing. Make sure to rewatch this video if you are having an issue getting them to do what you want them to. Don’t fret though, as a bit of practice is all it takes. Here is a run-down of the different types of spoons I use when playing music. Every type of spoon makes a different kind of sound.

On the other hand, one of the best things you can do to improve your mental health and happiness is to avoid getting romantically involved with emotionally immature people in the first place.

Its a movie about a cam girl who gets her identity stolen by an AI, but the movie never really shows who created the AI to steal her identity. It could have been Tinker, who works in IT, or the mean girl that was always number 1. My guess is that it was the porn website, so that they wouldn't have to give the Lola her half of the pay. I don't think it was the mean girl because she didn't want Lola to climb up the ranks, but honestly, the AI was doing 20 ranks better than Lola was. Thoughts? Read more Share New to Reddit?

The show opens with police in a northern English town bursting into the bedroom of 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) and arresting him because he’s suspected of stabbing a female classmate named Katie to death. Over four episodes, the Miller family is run through the wringer as they are catapulted into the criminal justice system. The show, which was filmed in one continuous shot and makes viewers feel like they are in the middle of the chaos, touches on ever-relevant themes like the dangers of social media and society’s expectations of what it means to be masculine.

The little black magic box. Like my mother used to tell me, “It’s what’s on the inside that counts.”Look at it… It’s kind of… boring!To my eye, the Ricoh GR III has little to no aesthetic appeal. It’s a small black rectangular box that doesn’t arouse me in any perceptible way. I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s undeniable that people care about the way their cameras look. Those who are still buying pocketable cameras in 2023, in light of the smart phone revolution, are doing so because they want a unique experience. At least from an aesthetics stan..."

Why didn't he help anyone else get home?? This is why I believe the BIW is evil. He could have helped Victor and his family return home. He could have helped everyone return, so he isn't good. He's keeping them in FromLand and seems to take pleasure in their suffering. If Tabitha is in the real world, BIW has the power to send others into the real world.

I used various AI tools to explore how far AI-assisted film production has come. Based on estimates from other producers and filmmakers, a film like this would typically cost between $300K and $500K without AI, depending on the scale of production. It would also require around 70 people and at least 2 months of work. Thanks to AI, this was reduced to just 1 person, $600 USD, and 2 weeks of non-continuous work. First, I wrote the story and screenplay, then I used various AI tools to turn my script into visuals. I used ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Dreamina for images; Kling AI for videos; ElevenLabs for voices; Dreamina AI for lip sync; Suno AI for music; and MMAudio or ElevenLabs for sound effects.

There may even be a few false alarms – after all, your due date is only an estimate. Whether labor begins on its own or you need an induction, it can be helpful to know what you may experience as your labor progresses toward delivering your baby, and when to head to the hospital or birth center. Below, we explain the three stages of labor and delivery for vaginal births. This includes what marks the start and end of each stage, how long each may last, how your body is likely to feel and more. Click the links below to jump to each of the three stages of labor: The first stage of labor is usually the longest as your body gets ready for delivery.

Is anyone else running into this challenge? He doesn’t have any teeth yet and only recently started on solids. When he does break off smaller pieces is it ok for him to have them or would that be a choking hazard? Appreciate the help and advice in advance! Read more Share New to Reddit?

Should I be concerned with this behavior?A: You were right on the money when you said it seems like your pup is in a trance. This behavior is actually called “dog trancing,” although it’s sometimes called “weed walking” or “ghost walking.” It definitely can be strange or concerning the first time you first see it.

Still, teaching your dog to tolerate head pats will go a long way to helping them cope with this unwelcome human interaction. Why Dog..."

Members • LucidLynx44 Why do forwards run the ball straight into the other team after the set piece? Genuinely curious about the strategy here.

Trying to walk but just falls onto her side like she can’t put weight on her legs. No swelling and no signs of injuries. She can grip with her feet still and will hold onto my fingers. Eating and drinking fine. She was broody last week but we broke it after 4 days of her not eating or drinking. My dad says a chicken was locked out last night but I’m not sure if it was her so I’ll have to ask when he gets home. No prolapse or blood. She’s near the bottom of the pecking order but most of the birds are pretty nice so she hasn’t bee..."

It's natural to focus on your baby's birth while you're pregnant. But it's a good idea to also know what to expect after labour.Skin-to-skin contact really helps with bonding. It's a good idea to have your baby lifted onto you as soon as they're born and before the cord is cut so you can be close to each other straight away.Either before, or just after the cord is clamped, your baby will be dried and then covered with a towel to stop them getting cold. You can continue to hold and cuddle your baby while this is done.Your baby may have some of your blood on their skin and perhaps vernix, the greasy white substance that protects your baby's skin in the womb.If you prefer, you can ask the mid..."

Members • kyillme 中文 (繁體) Why does my cat walk around the house with a toy in her mouth yelling at the top of her lungs every night? Behavioral I’ve had my cat for about 7 years, and every night she grabs a specific toy (a sashimi plush) and carries it around the house absolutely screaming for no apparent reason. If the toy is not accessible she gets me and makes me get it for her so she can do this. She sometimes will bring it to me and drop it in front of my feet while still yelling, but if I toss it thinking she wants to play she looks at me like I’m a complete idiot. Usually she just drops it and lays down..."

Or, maybe it’s more of a mournful holler? Regardless: Every single night without fail for about six weeks now, Newtie yowls. She goes upstairs while we’re downstairs–it’s only ever if we’re on separate levels–and she yowls. Then she picks up a cat toy in her mouth while still vocalizing, carries the cat toy somewhere else, drops it, and yowls some more. As..."

Advice Basically I am asking if a cat makes the connection that the dangle toy they are playing with is controlled by the human and that this is a bonding experience with that human.

I mean, I liked the trial, and loved when Natalia walked in to justify, and how everyone seemed (semi)happy again at the ending sequence, but I also think the series could have explained many things just sooo much better. Many answers of questions that deserved screen time, were just left for the watcher to figure out from context or forgotten about all together. I also found the juxtaposition between Chiara's en Ludo's ending a bit too big. Like Ludo gets as an ending this amazing life in Paris where all her wrongs have been forgotten, while C..."
