Home Articles & Essays Books 48 Hours from Ground Zero Secret Rock Knowledge Blog Archives Home Articles & Essays Books 48 Hours from Ground Zero Secret Rock Knowledge Blog Archives What does that guy say at the end of the Radiohead’s video for “Just”? In case you’ve never seen the video–from Radiohead’s excellent second album, The Bends—it’s got two components. One is the band, looking misanthropic and unwashed, giving it their all as they pantomime rocking out in an apartment. The other is a narrative, filmed in a style reminiscent of director Douglas Sirk: a well-dressed man, an archetypal businessman, suddenly lies down in the middle of the sidewalk, curled up as if he wants his blanket. Someone else trips over him, and then discovers that the man doesn’t want to get up. He says he’s not drunk or crazy, but despite the entreaties of a gathering crowd, he won’t get up and won’t explain why he’s ..."

It was shot near Liverpool Street Station in London. In the clip's original edit, performance footage of the band is interspersed throughout the theatrical sequences. However, there are two additional edits of the video, which separate the performance and movie-like sequences. \"The original works best because it builds an incredible tension that is never resolved,\" says Yorke. \"We all decided that we would never tell anybody about the 'meaning' of the end of the clip.\" Capitol video VP of visual promotion Linda Ingrisano says that the man's response is not even written in the script for the video, which is a production of Oil Factory. \"I've had more inquiries about this clip than any other in my entire career,\" says Ingrisano. \"It's almost as if the clip touches on the secret to life in the universe...."

Aimee Ferrier Fri 15 September 2023 21:30, UK Following their lacklustre debut album Pablo Honey, Radiohead earned the respect of critics with their sophomore release, The Bends, in 1995. No longer were the Oxford outfit known for simply being the band who made ‘Creep’; their status was instantly elevated with their musically and thematically complex second album. The Bends is one of the band’s most coveted records, with some of their most recognisable hits appearing on it, such as ‘High and Dry’, ‘Fake Plastic Trees’ and ‘Street Spirit (Fade Out)’. Then there’s ‘Just’, one of the band’s most anthemic cuts, and it’s hard to stop yourself from singing along with Thom Yorke’s declarations of “you do it to yourself, you do/ And that’s why it really..."

I have a 18-month-old son and a 3-year-old daughter who are very stubborn and throw tantrums when they don’t get their way. One thing that really upsets me is that my son scratches and bites other children.

When ever there are other small children around, he is a bully and is either pinching, biting, or pushing etc.. I don’t know how to make him realize that this is bad behavior and how to stop him from doing this. I get so angry and end up giving him a spanking and a time out.

Positional preferences like this are VERY common in newborns and - fun fact - right-turning is more common than left-turning. Were you even aware that this was a \"thing?\" If not, you're not alone. Let’s talk about head-turning preferences; not to scare you or make you obsessively check your baby’s head position, but because if you can catch this little newborn quirk early, it tends to resolve very quickly and easily with some simple tweaks. Unnoticed and unaddressed, favoring one side over the other can quickly snowball into longer-term and harder to treat conditions and complications.I ..."

I understand this is a fairly common thing, but I guess I’m just trying to see if someone out there can describe how this impacts them? Is it a way to focus for them? A way not to focus?

Why Does My Baby Always Look To One Side? 12/1/2020 5 Comments If you notice your baby is always looking to one side, either the right or the left, there are a couple things it could be… The two main causes of this in babies is either torticollis or a \"turn preference\". Torticollis is when your little one tilts their head and/or their body in one direction and turns it in the opposite direction. Typically, these babies have difficulty turning their head to the other side and, if you turn it that way for them, they don't like to keep it there. With a \"turn preference\", there may not be an obvious tilting component like there is with torticollis and it may seem like your little one is able to turn in the other direction, they just don't like to. This is a little misleading th..."
