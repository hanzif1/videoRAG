The Hole is a representation of the world / our societies. Every society is ruled by the top percenters. The more money you have, the more influence you have on those who are poorer than you i.e. the different socioeconomic levels. The more you have, the more responsibility you have for those less fortunate than you. If you are on the top floor and eat someone else’s food, maybe just a bite, it has..."

All you need is a ping pong ball and a working hair dryer. I had one son hold the hair dryer straight up, while it blew cool air at the highest setting. Our other boy gingerly moved a ping pong ball into the air stream. WHOA! They were amazed to see the ball float in mid-air without falling. Even more fun is when they moved the hair dryer at a slight angle to see the ball still stay suspended! Why it Works The force of air from the hair dryer will push the ball up, and the force of gravity will push it down. It will stay suspended at the point where the force pushing up and gravity pulling it down are equal. The reason the ball does not shoot out of the stream of air, is air pressure. ..."

My day job inspired my ambition to wear the same clothes every day. At work, I wear a uniform. I don’t have to think about what I have to wear, I just need to make sure my clothes are clean, and I’m good to go! However, when I think about applying the same philosophy to my personal attire, I have my reservations, and I’m sure you do too. That’s why in this post, I’m going to take a deep dive into why it is beneficial to wear the same clothes every day. We’ll also be looking at common objections against integrating such a polarising system into your wardrobe. If implementing a personal..."

Kilimanjaro – Past and Present Each morning I wake, I’m lucky enough to look outside and see across the valley to Mt. Rose, the highest peak (at 10,778 feet) in the greater Sierra Nevada mountain range within Nevada. This time of year it is blanketed in snow, which sometimes doesn’t melt until late summer. In fact, there have been years that patches of snow can be seen until October when the first storms of the winter begin to roll in. When the sun rises on cold, clear winter mornings and the light turns Mt. Rose pink, it is a truly breathtaking sight.

A new world order will happen that causes an alliance between some of these nations. Sort of like the United Nations. These countries will team up and unite against a common enemy for a period of time. There will be a lot of death, destruction, disease, famine, war, natural disaster, and many more tragedies.

These teachings invited us into a deeply resonant truth: our strength is often found in weakness, healing comes when we reveal our hidden wounds, and true life is discovered when we are ready to surrender. Inspired by the story of the man with a withered hand in Luke 6, Jesus’ invitation to “stretch out your hand” serves as a powerful metaphor for our own spiritual journey and a foundational story for us at Become New. This series has been a time of deep reflection, vulnerability, and transformation for our community—a Fellowship of the Withered Hand. Let’s celebrate the lessons learned, the ..."

The line up between legs helps create the BEST possible sit alignment, for the most power forward towards the first obstacle. Remember - the dog's hind end is where the power comes from!

It’s packed with layers, callbacks and blink-and-you’ll-miss-it details that make the whole thing even richer. Here are a few gems that stood out. Desiree Bowie April 22, 2025 9 minutes Sinners is hands down one of my favorite films of the decade. I’ve already watched it twice (in IMAX 70mm and Dolby 🙌🏾), and then went down a rabbit hole of research to catch all the details I may have missed, which I’ll lay out here. Set in 1932, Ryan Coogler’s genre-bending blockbuster follows notorious twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who return to their hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi, to open a juke joint at a sawmill they’ve just bought.

I’ve mentioned before that the Twelve Dancing Princesses is on my top ten list of favorite fairy tales. And there are many reasons why.

Its appeal is obvious, it’s quick to prepare, easy to manage and often keeps them quiet for ages! But have you ever looked closely at your child’s drawing? Have you stared hard at their scribbles trying to decipher what they’ve drawn? Or worried what their sudden over-use of a black crayon might mean for their mental health? I still remember the feeling of pride when my children brought me their first recognisable stick man. And I’m sure I’m not alone in pondering whether my children have inherited their creative gene from me or their father! What you might not know is that children tend to go through ..."

After semen is released into the vagina, sperm immediately separates from the remaining ejaculate and sperms begin moving into the cervix and up into the uterus for fertilization in the fallopian tubes.
