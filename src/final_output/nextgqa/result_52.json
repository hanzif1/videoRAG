What does this mean though? It is easy to get confused about the difference between the two. Scrum, (one of the most popular software development frameworks) is an iterative method that teaches teams to deliver “potentially shippable increments” each iteration. Confused? That’s ok. You’re not alone. Lots of people are confused by this. When we were doing research and writing “Delivering in Increments” (which became one of the Fundamentals of Value, Flow, Quality), Dan Rough and I spent some time discussing how to explain the difference between increments and iterations[1]. One of the most popular references explaining iterations comes from Jeff Patton, who does a great job encouraging teams to take it..."

Positional preferences like this are VERY common in newborns and - fun fact - right-turning is more common than left-turning. Were you even aware that this was a \"thing?\" If not, you're not alone. Let’s talk about head-turning preferences; not to scare you or make you obsessively check your baby’s head position, but because if you can catch this little newborn quirk early, it tends to resolve very quickly and easily with some simple tweaks. Unnoticed and unaddressed, favoring one side over the other can quickly snowball into longer-term and harder to treat conditions and complications.I ..."

We live in a three-dimensional world. Our bodies need the ability to move in all three dimensions. Poor range of motion and instability in just a single joint can cause over compensation. These alternate movement patterns can lead to chronic pain and injury. By improving three-dimensional movement, you reduce your risk for injury and are more likely to achieve your fitness (and life) goals. Your ability to function day-to-day will also become easier. Loading groceries, playing with the kids, and even doing yard work will become effortless and more enjoyable.  (Or at least “less un-enjoyable” when pulling weeds and taking out the trash.)

Welcome! Members • Badatmath212 Tiếng Việt中文 (繁體) What to do when baby starts lifting suction plate? 10 months old My almost 10mo has realized he can lift the suction plate off the high chair. I’ve started taking the plate away because he lifts it and doesn’t seem upset when it’s taken away. I know it’s play but also that is a huge mess to clean up when he dumps it all over the floor. If I just put the food on the high chair tray he smacks his hands on it and windshield wipes the food off the tray 😅 Edited to add- how are you doing this 3x/day?? Read more Share New to Reddit?

I am finally learning how to ski! It's something I wanted for a long time so I'm super excited. I had an instructor for the first 3 days and now I have 3 days on my own until I head back home. Our instructor told us to ditch the poles for now as they only get in the way when you're a new skier. They make you lose balance more easily because you're flailing around with your arms and they often break because people fall on them. I already did a 4th day of skiing on my own (no poles) and I'm quite happy with my progress. I can already do all the blue slopes comfortably (not WELL, but I'm not scared for my life).

I have made original costumes in the past, but this year I really wanted to go all out! I am a senior art major at James Madison University, and my focus is in studio art, graphic design, and art history. My classes take up almost all of my time and I am constantly creating art in many forms. Though, I rarely get to do for myself and create art just for the love of art and not just for an elaborate assignment!This year for Halloween I decided to change this unfortunate fact and do something completely original and completely hobby related. For once, this meant no school assignments, no critiques, no crazy deadlines, this was going to be just for me a..."

(An honest convo) I have been following not so much Coldplay as I have been following Chris Martin for a while. I find him to be one of the most interesting, complex, difficult-to-pin down human beings on planet earth, and I am saying that from the perspective of a non-superfan who does love a handful of Coldplay songs (Square One! Don't Panic! Arabesque! A L I E N S!) but otherwise gets icked out by a lot of their music and by the man who sings it.

(Audio begins around 0:15) Abstract We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds accurately convey..."

TL;DR: VIST3A unifies a video generator and a multi-view 3D reconstruction model into a single latent diffusion model that generates 3D representations directly from text. Summary of Our Method Core Innovation We unify a video generator and a multi-view 3D reconstruction model into a single latent diffusion framework. To achieve this, we stitch a pretrained 3D foundation model into the video VAE latent space, reusing strong 3D priors for efficient adaptation. We then apply direct reward finetuning to align the generated latents with 3D quality and geometri..."

We went through the nursing class yesterday. The lactation expert recommended not to introduce bottles until breast feeding is well established, which she estimated could be between 3-6 weeks. I don’t think my wife will be able to handle the lack of sleep if she’s feeding the baby every 3 hours for weeks. We had planned to take care of the baby in shifts so we could each get longer periods of sleep, so obviously during my shift I would be using a bottle. So when did you introduce bottle feeding? ..."
