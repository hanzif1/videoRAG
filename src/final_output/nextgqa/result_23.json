The most common underlying cause of calcinosis is either endogenous Cushing’s disease or iatrogenic Cushing’s disease. It can also be a sign of chronic renal failure. If caught early enough, your dog has a good chance of recovering from calcinosis cutis without having to undergo a surgical procedure to remove the deposits. Medications can be used to break up the deposit and have the calcium reabsorb back into your dog’s body.Calcinosis cutis in dogs is when deposits of insoluble mineral salts occur in the different layers of the skin. These mineral deposits will cause dystrophic or metastatic calcification. In dogs, it is more common to have dystrophic calcificatio..."

In the first two posts (on “Down, down baby”, and “Miss Mary Mack”), I started with recent hip hop incarnations.

Members Online • cheexy85 When did your baby start interacting with toys? Skills and Milestones My 16 week old does not interact with any toys. I bought him a Fisher Price kick and play piano gym and everytime I place him on the mat, he just lays there doing nothing. He actually raises his body so he doesn't touch the piano with his feet. He doesn't play with the rattle I bought him either. He is a happy baby overall so I'm wondering if I have introduced them too early. I'm just checking if your LOs were interacting with their toys at this age. Read more Share New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities. Continue with Email ..."

She's 6 weeks old and I know she can't self sooth but it seems like when I hold her and rock her it makes her even more awake. Is it really that bad to put her in the swing for 5-10mins to see if that will do the trick? My back is KILLING me trying to rock her for what seems like hours. Read more Archived post.

They may not be able to solve problems and consider others' feelings. They will use hitting others or snatching toys as ways to solve problems. They may also express their emotions by attacking others when they feel frustrated or upset. Provide opportunities for your child to learn how to mix with other children. Here are some suggestions you can try: Talk with your child and set rules together with her on playing with other kids, such as “turn taking” or “be nice to other kids”. State the consequences of breaking the rules clearly such as “take away your toy for 1 minute” or “go to quiet time for 1 minute”. Praise her if she plays with others in a friendly way. Stop her immediately if she hits other..."

Surely Colton must have realized this was a possibility, given that we now know he’s a time traveler. Also, his being a time traveller definitely explains why he was so adamant that everyone needed to stay away from the sinkhole. Read more Share New to Reddit?

For me, it’s hard to think, but it was true for Narcissus.Narcissus was a man in ancient Greece, admired by all for being exceptionally handsome.

Unable to reach out and touch this captivating creature, Narcissus wasted away, pining for an impossible love.Time and time again, dear reader, we’ve been told to not be arrogant.

Members Online • IAmBillN What artistic control does the camera operator have during shooting? Composition Question I'm asking about a specific scenario... when I've watched outtakes of shows, I've noticed it's not uncommon for the camera operator to react when someone in the frame starts to break and they will reframe the shot to try to take that person out of the frame. It looks as though they're trying to salvage some of the footage, but perhaps I'm reading into it too much. Is that entirely in the hands of the camera operator to do that or are they somehow being signaled by the DP to do that? Just curious to know if this i..."

When NYPD Blue launched in 1993, it was praised for the work of Dennis Franz, new kinds of dialogue from Steven Bochco and David Milch, and an ensemble style that built on the innovations of Hill Street Blues.  But what made it striking for many people it was the visual style, the camera work.

The story behind the iconic ‘Tank Man’ photo Photographs by Jeff Widener/APStory by Kyle Almond, CNN A man blocks a line of tanks on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989. At first, Jeff Widener was annoyed by the man entering his shot. Widener, a photographer with the Associated Press, was focusing his camera on a line of tanks in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square when out of the blue came this man in a white shirt and dark trousers, carrying what appeared to be shopping bags. Widener thought the man was going to mess up the composition of his frame. Little did he know that he was about to make one of the most iconic photos in history. Before “Tank Man,” pro-democracy demonstrators had been occupying Tiananmen Square for weeks. Here, a young woman is caught between civilians and Chinese soldiers who were trying to remove her from an assembly near the Great Hall of the..."

Here's what to know — and how to be helpful. by Virginia PelleyNovember 7, 2019Richard Chance for FatherlyIt was a long day, and you’re on the couch with your wife, remote in hand. She’s exhausted, too, after having taken care of the baby all day, so you reach over and try to put your arm around her. Instead of snuggling into your armpit and relaxing, she stiffens. Her jaw tightens and her eyes, lit by the glow of the TV, are glued to the images on screen like her life depends upon her concentration. The fun, loving person you married now seems like a trapped animal ready to spring. The last thing she seems to want is physical closeness.

One owl’s hoots were deeper than the other one. I’d say their pitch was about a major third apart. (I used to be a music teacher.) The two owls continued for about thirty minutes, or until I fell asleep. The question is: What was all the hooting about and do you think these were two different species of owls? – Joe, Brewster (MA) Very comprehensive, Joe, The rest of the readers don’t know it (because I did a lot of editing of your question), but your description of the owl calls was one of the most complete..."

However, often, they come across one another. Both breeds occupy the same forests but differ in their living standards. The great horned owl is an excellent night hunter; no one could see this bird gliding through the air at night. It feeds on animals, from the size of rodents to other bird species they prey on.

Soon, a second owl joined it, from roughly the same location. Then, way off in the distance, a third owl started calling. My book says that owls usually call in late winter, but this was September. Why were they calling at such an odd time of year? Also, do you think, since there were three owls calling, that it was a family? – Jess, Jackson, WY Me too, Jess, I have that same book, the book that tells everyone to go outside on the coldest night of the winter to listen for calling Great Horned Owls.

Crows vs Owls: What is going on? 27 February 2017 Great Horned Owl by Dan Tallman Cats and mice, spiders and flies, and wolves and elk are all animals that we think of being arch-enemies of one another. But we can add another pair to our list: owls and crows. Anytime crows see an owl flying around they will harass it continually to try and keep the owl awake and annoyed. Although this seems cruel, the crows may not actually be the villains of our story, indeed, it is somewhat unclear who the true villain is. Regardless of which animal you support, the crow vs owl story is an interesting one to consid..."

Look at her, standing there at the back of the church without a prayer book, or in the abandoned graveyard. Or, rather – don’t look at her. You never know what you might unleash.
