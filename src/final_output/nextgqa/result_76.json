Members • _the_investigator How is that an electric bulb lights up as soon as we turn the switch on? Physics Inside a solid,the atoms are packed together with very little spacing between them.When a steady current flows through a conductor, the electrons in it move with a certain average 'drift speed'.This drift speed is very small,about 1mmps. How is it then that an electric bulb lights up as soon as we turn the switch on? It cannot be that a current starts only when an electron from one terminal of the electric supply physically reaches the other terminal through the bulb,because the physical drift of electrons in the conducting wires is a very slow process.

Quite often, this will be perfectly innocent and there will be nothing sinister about it. However, it can create a problem if they are constantly congregating outside of your own house, with issues such as noise and litter just two of the less serious problems this can cause.

I grimace every time I hear this because, for so many of us who live here, Washington, D.C. is more than just the seat of government or where national politics happen. It’s our home. Making the name of a city synonymous with such divisive views overshadows everything that Washington, D.C. has to offer.

The story behind the iconic ‘Tank Man’ photo Photographs by Jeff Widener/APStory by Kyle Almond, CNN A man blocks a line of tanks on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989. At first, Jeff Widener was annoyed by the man entering his shot. Widener, a photographer with the Associated Press, was focusing his camera on a line of tanks in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square when out of the blue came this man in a white shirt and dark trousers, carrying what appeared to be shopping bags. Widener thought the man was going to mess up the composition of his frame. Little did he know that he was about to make one of the most iconic photos in history. Before “Tank Man,” pro-democracy demonstrators had been occupying Tiananmen Square for weeks. Here, a young woman is caught between civilians and Chinese soldiers who were trying to remove her from an assembly near the Great Hall of the..."

If the firearm moved before the round left the trajectory would be off and no firearm, as they are used today, would be accurate. My understanding from years of using firearms is that recoil doesn't move the weapon until the round has exited the barrel. While I understand reaction to start at the time the round is ignited, I believe the mass of the weapon itself has to be overcome before it begins to move. I am sure there are a lot better explanations. EDIT: Video: http://www.yout..."

                "detail": "Sam Harris | Home of the Making Sense PodcastBackEssaysThe Riddle of the GunJanuary 2, 2013Fantasists and zealots can be found on both sides of the debate over guns in America. On the one hand, many gun-rights advocates reject even the most sensible restrictions on the sale of weapons to the public. On the other, proponents of stricter gun laws often seem unable to understand why a good person would ever want ready access to a loaded firearm. Between these two extremes we must find grounds for a rational discussion about the problem of gun violence. Unlike most Americans, I stand on both sides of this debate. I understand the apprehension that many people feel toward “gun culture,” and I share their outrage over the political influence of the National Rifle Association. How is it that we live in a society in which one of the most compelling interests is gun ownership? Where is the science lobby? The safe food lobby? Where is the get-the-Chinese-lead-paint-out-of-our-kids’-toys lobby? W..."
