I'm an opera enthusiast from South Korea, and I'm doing my own amateur translations because there are so few good ones out there. My first publicly available translation of Bluebeard's Castle is approaching its one-year anniversary, so I started a new blog to promote my book as well. As my first post, I'm writing a recap of my Bluebeard's Castle translation, and as I was explaining how I interpret Bluebeard's Castle, I realized that the Door 7 is quite unexpected. Let me share my interpretation (English translation of what I wrote) first. (...) So let's talk about the piece. As f..."

I’ve been paying taxes for a long time. Obviously, I’ve yet to experience my own death, but I have had people close to me die. The drinking traditions that accompany the death of a loved one are interesting to me. My family, friends and I have often celebrated by drinking after a funeral or in memory of the person that died. Usually we are reminiscing about things the person who passed had done or funny stories of our times with them. I guess that’s our own tradition and one I know most people do. I’d also heard the term “pour one out”. I don’t know where or how that phrase started and realized that there are probably many more traditions around death and drinking so I figured I’d do some research. Pour One Out To p..."

Nails scratching your guest’s skin, dog nose jabbing into their face. Many trainers suggest you ignore your dog, and only give your dog attention when she or he is sitting or standing with all feet on the floor.

And as a child, the freedom I had to experience nature's sights, sounds and smells was pure joy. We watched lions baking in the sun. We ran with giraffes, zebras and foxes. We chased hyraxes -- rabbit-size animals -- through the sand. I was so happy. Gradually, those happy times disappeared. Life became harder. By five I knew what it was to be an African woman, to live with terrible suffering in a passive, helpless manner. Women are the backbone of Africa; they do most of the work.

They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, “Tin soldiers!” uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable.

But what exactly makes us happy and how can we be happier?Recognizing Happiness On the outside, happiness is easy to recognize. We mig..."

It’s a peculiar occurrence that’s been whispered about in trucking circles for years, and I recently stumbled upon a YouTube short that brought back some intriguing memories from my days on the road.The video featured a conversation between two truck drivers — one young, one old — discussing encounters with the elusive ‘black dog’. For those unfamiliar, the story goes that while driving, usually in the dead of night, a black dog suddenly appears in the middle of the highway, running straight towards your vehicle. The encounter causes panic and concern, but when you brace for i..."

Nosleep is a place for redditors to share their scary personal experiences. Members Online • Barkles52 Tiếng Việt I saw the black dog when I was falling asleep at the wheel. Help me. There’s an urban legend that’s especially common among truck drivers. It’s actually such a big phenomenon that there was a movie made in 1998 called “Black Dog” starring Patrick Swayze. Anyway, my experience with seeing the black dog was nothing like what the urban legend says happens. I guess I’ll start by telling you about the urban legend for those of you that aren’t familiar with it. Have you ever driven late at night and you’re so tired that you start to feel your eyelids weigh down and you’re on the verge of falling asleep? Well when you’re in that s..."

As I delved deep into my research the black dog was not the only spookiness I uncovered. History of Mildenhall Mildenhall was an important place for Roman settlers as the main roads from Bath to Newbury and Cirencester to Winchester ran through the centre. A Roman settlement, Cunieto, was built to the south of Black Field with a military camp on the site of what is now Folly Farm. This was connected by a fosse. By the 5th century, the settlement had been abandoned and crumbled back into the land. It was many centuries later that it was rediscovered after..."

Screenshot from my Google Slides The time allocated for my talk was 25min + 5min for Q&A. Since this was a non-tech talk that didn’t require much visual support, I decided to combine text slides with blank slides. You can find the final deck here. My strategy was this: Use blank slides for the moments when I’m telling my story. Like this, the focus of the audience is on what I’m saying. Use text slides only for quotes and main take-aways. These would only appear in the key moments of my presentation and the audience should focus on them. The effect of the take-aways is now amplified, since these ..."

The American poet Robert Frost wrote a very well-known poem about birches in winter. Reading it is like listening to the musings of a New England farmer, but of course Robert Frost is only “rural” on the surface.

But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay. Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain. They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed So low fo..."

I was intrigued by this thought I had, but I can't seem to find a definitive answer online, and some even says a bond cannot be formed between fluids of different densities at all. So I wanted to reach out to some experts for some answers. For example, if you mix a fat and a oil together, would it increase in density or reduce in density? I'm not sure how the density would change since both fibres are still quite large when mixed together (maybe not bonded), and thus it shouldn't change it's density, right? Open to expert opinions.

As she talked about her trajectory, she casually acknowledged how her looks have made her life easier. “I’m conventionally pretty, so that helps. I do get treated well,” she said, with the kind of breezy but empty self-awareness that now dominates our social media age. As she uttered those words, a fire started to travel through my stomach and up to my chest. Those emotions?

They are typically wire mesh fences 2–2.5 m high running parallel to the road. Although fencing may protect wildlife from traffic, it should not create an absolute barrier that prevents migration, isolates populations, fragments habitat, or causes injuries.

Members Online • maalipas Tiếng Việt中文 (繁體) Do you put your non sitting baby in a sitting position?
