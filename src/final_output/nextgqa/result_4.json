Members Online • AndyTheMusicLover Tiếng Việt Why do some singers move the mic further away during performance? Technique Talk (Topic must be included in title) Just watched a live-video of Andy Black (https://youtu.be/WTtnbDmLVSo?si=0BW_Ced2Dg2Pm1cz), which is pre-recorded but still valid. He does this a lot: during louder or higher parts, he moves his microphone considerably further away from his mouth. Now, he probably does this to even the dynamic-levels.

At some point as a singer you will probably sing with a microphone either on a stand or held in your hand. This is usually what's called a dynamic microphone.

This position will barely pick up the sound in a clear way. Instead hold it horizontal with the cone facing your mouth. You are also going to want to make sure your mouth is abou..."

This wouldn’t be the biggest issue in the world but since I’m weaning and my supply is decreasing, he is now getting frustrated when he tries to latch to pacify himself.

But after a couple hours, the water from my bowl will go down, and down, and down to the point where there's almost no water anymore. It doesn't flush or anything like that, it just disappears. Any idea what might cause this? Thank you. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share New to Reddit?

With the outbreak of hostilities tween North and South, women had suspended activities on their own behalf to devote full energy to the Union cause, The contributions of women to the war effort were substantial: they performed nursing service (Clara Barton is noted for her frontline work with Civil War wounded), fund-raising. and even some brave military exploits. In addition, a National Woman's Loyal League was formed under the leadership of Susan 8. Anthony. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and others, which, in effect, functioned as an arm of the Republican Party's radical wing. In this capacity, the Woman's Loyal League collected hundreds of thousands of petition signatures calling for abolition of slavery. When enfranchisement of black men bec..."

I come from another field - the country of the slave. They have got their liberty - so much good luck to have slavery partly destroyed; not entirely. I want it root and branch destroyed. Then we will all be free indeed. I feel that if I have to answer for the deeds done in my body just as much as a man, I have a right to have just as much as a man. There is a great stir about colored men getting their rights, but not a word about the colored women; and if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before. So I am for keeping the thing going while things are stirring; because if we wait till it is..."

When a woman expresses her longing for a man, it shows how much she truly misses him. Women are cautious and reserved in matters of the heart, so when they say sentimental things, they mean it.When a woman misses a man, he must pay attention to her feelings. If a woman expresses her longing and the man is indifferent, she will be hurt.Communication is key. Some men may not invest much in a relationship but still win over women w..."

Menu Home About Contact Menu When Birds Mean Death Posted on October 31, 2023October 15, 2024 by Robert Francis Last October, I flew back home to South Dakota to visit my parents for apple cider season. My dad planted an apple orchard years ago, and coming back to make apple cider with family and friends is my favorite fall tradition.

I’ve had hawk fly right by my deck (very unusual) often these last weeks, and now a hawk has come and sat on my deck post and watched me take a picture of him; I was so excited thus the blur. I’m just happy I got this shot of him with my camera. He sat there quite awhile. Humm! Not that everything that happens to me is significant but I thought, I wonder what it means to the indians or folklore people? So I asked the above question online and found these answers: Best Answer – Chosen by Asker “The hawk is a messenger bird.

If you appreciate \"elevated horror\", then check this one out. The technical work, story, and acting are all top notch. But something didn't sit right with me when I finished it... the ending... You see, in the ending to Smile 2, we get this weird cop out. The whole sequence where Skye is put into a mental hospital and accidentally kills her own mother, then escaping, and then finding the nurse to make herself die, is suddenly cut away from.

The last shot of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece, The Shining, has left millions of movie watchers asking the same question: “Huh?” Today, I will attempt to answer that question. I admit that I, one of the film’s greatest fans, spent the last 32 years simply accepting the final shot as nothing more than a chilling way to reinforce the notion that Jack Torrance was always the Caretaker of the Overlook Hotel.

Members Online • [deleted] Tiếng Việt Tips on getting back into playing after a 5 year hiatus? First session - I sound nothing like I used to and i’m a little heartbroken So, I played the flute all through school. I was passionate about it; I made the All state orchestra each year of high school as well as won a few solo competitions. But, my parents were extremely pressuring, and insisted that I major in flute performance. They were also always upset if I didn’t perform to their very high standards. Their pressure turned me off of music completely, and now i’m 22 and have barely touched my flute since I was 17. Anyways, I miss it now, so I tried to play again, and my first practice session did not go well. My tone was okay, but far from where it once was..."

I immediately say, “check for popped springs.” When a student tells me that “my flute won’t play”, I immediately say “check for popped springs”. They always say, “Springs?” Your flute has some thin, tiny little metal sticks that we call springs. Most of the keys on your flute are open all of the time unless pushed down by one of your fingers.  Occasionally (sometimes never) one of these little springs will pop out from under its spring cradle and create the problem of its connected key to be laying down when it is not supposed to be. When a spring is popped, your flute will sound terrible..."

I dropped my pack, sank to the ground and leaned against a tree. I stretched out my legs and closed my eyes, and for about a minute, maybe two, I forgot where I was and dreamed of home. My mother, sitting on a low stool in the kitchen, her feet on two metal rods steadying the iron pot on the fire. Her fat arms rippled, sweat dripping down her face, as she stirred the banku with a long wooden spatula.  ‘Abla, the bowls!’  she would call out. ‘Sitso, the table!’ She was a woman of few words. Johnson Maclean, headmaster of the Labadi School for Young Boys, brought me here, and for that, even if I die today, I know I would never forgive him.

To be a flute-maker is to be an endangered species.  Flute-makers in Scotland go back to the 17thcentury but now there is only one left. George’s flutes are in demand across the world so what makes them so special?  He is an expert in woodwork, a silversmith and also makes his own tools.  In the last 40 years he’s made around 1,200 beautiful wooden flutes.  George is a senior philosophy student in the Edinburgh School. Scotland’s Last Flute-Maker George Ormiston, Bo’ness, Scotland Coming from a family of musicians and singers, I was attracted to the sound of the wooden flute and began to play when I was sixteen. That was about the same time as taking up an apprenticeship in engineering. Both became real passions, and the combination led me to make my first flute at about the age of 27.

Maybe we can help! Members Online • Curious_Present_5754 “Help” hand signal, from girl named “Kole Tocha”. Can anybody find the original video? Or have information about what happened? Open Need help finding this original video, this is Kole Tocha, or atleast that’s what her instagram says. I came across this video of her using the hand signal for “Help” her thumb is tucked under her fingers and near the end of the video her hand begins to shake and her face begins to go a little grim. In her instagram she looks perfectly fine though, just turned 17 not to long ago and she seems happy and well. I’m just trying to understand what this was all about, who this guy is and why she was asking for help. I left my comments under this vide..."

Members Online • Outside_Wash_4755 [TOMT] Video/meme of an 80s/90s video with a woman who spins around slowly and puts her hand out as if to say ‘ta-da’ Solved I’m looking for a meme/short video where the idea is like ‘how to end a presentation’. All I can remember is that it’s from the 80s/90s, and there is a woman who awkwardly turns around and then puts her hand out as if to say ‘ta-da’. Then I think there were a few other similar short moves from different people afterwards. It wasn’t like a dance video or aerobics - it was normal people in normal clothes. Thank you!
