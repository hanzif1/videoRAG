We have less awareness of what a particular body zone is doing physically the further away it is from our head. If we pay limited attention most of us will be aware of our facial expressions and gestures. Even those less adept can readily simulate a staged smile or frown on command to evoke an emotion for someone else though other subtle gestural clues in conflict might give you away. We remain less conscious of what our arms and hands are doing most times, and even more so with our chest and stomach.

They were used to pull the carriages in which the family travelled and were also kept for riding and horse-racing, two much-loved pastimes at Emo. The 2nd Earl of Portarlington won many races at the Curragh with famous horses such as Shamrock, Wasp and Haphazard, while the 5th Earl’s horse, Snowdon, won numerous show-jumping contests. The 6th Earl of Portarlington clearly shared this passion, as the contents of his bedroom included no less than 34 racing pictures!

Many Polish customs date back to pre-Christian, Slavic practices. The custom of pouring water is an ancient spring rite of cleansing, purification, and fertility. The same is true of the complimentary practice of switching with pussy willow branches. Since 966 A.D., Dyngus Day has been associated with the baptism of Prince Mieszko I. T..."

Answer The first mention of bitter water in the Bible is Exodus 15:23. As the Israelites traveled in the wilderness, they came to a spring of water. But when they tried to drink it, they found that the water was bitter. The word translated “bitter” is marah in Hebrew, and that became the name of the place. The water may have had a salty, metallic taste and was undrinkable in the way that ocean water is undrinkable. There still exist springs in that region with bitter-tasting water.

Answer The story of the woman with the issue of blood can be found in Mark 5:24–34 and Luke 8:42–48. Though neither account is very long, Mark’s account provides a few more details than Luke’s. The story of this woman takes place within a larger story. Jesus is on his way to a synagogue leader’s house to heal his dying daughter (see Mark 5:21–24) when an unnamed woman causes an interruption to His progress. What we know about the woman is, first, she had a bleeding conditio..."

Sometimes Jesus healed somebody to make a point, for example the man lowered through the roof who Jesus healed to prove that he had the power to forgive sins having just forgiven the man, re..."

In Luke 8:45, a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years touches Jesus’ cloak and is healed. Jesus then asks: \"Who touched me?\" But if Jesus is all-knowing, why did He ask this question? Was He testing the woman’s faith? Was He giving her an opportunity to publicly testify? Did He temp..."

Question I’m 21 weeks and I can clearly feel her move if I sit down (and have something to eat/drink). She gets increasingly active whenever I drink rooibos tea. But I’m afraid she’s hating it, and that rooibos tea is the reason why she’s flailing about. I don’t really get the same reaction whenever I eat chocolate (she moves, but not as much). How do I know if she likes or hates it? I don’t want to upset her. 🥺 Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share New to Reddit?
