Having beat the game, felt the sadness drip from the canvas in both endings, and read on the many discussions here on the subreddit, I can’t help but feel like people often skip on one little detail: Verso’s soul. Before I get to the point I want to make, I first want to contextualize all of the relevant discussion point from the story to add to their complexity. The other ending discussion posts deliberate into further detail on these points, and I recommend reading them as well. Anyway, here they are. Both Maelle and Verso have selfish reasons for ..."

Biting and Teething I'm on week 4 with my pup and have been redirecting since I got her at 8 weeks and will occasionally do reverse time-outs (but she doesn't seem to really care about that unfortunately) and she still gets very bitey. If all else fails I crate her for a nap. Those that have used this method, how long did it take to sink in? Am I not doing something right if it's taking this long or is it a long process?

We’re constantly covered in bite marks. Redirecting to a toy Does. Not. Work. Or it works for 3 seconds and then he’s back trying to bite us. We still try it every single time. But he will even actively avoid biting the toy just so he can come back and bite us and he is relentless. I’ve heard this is a completely normal puppy phase but it’s to the point where I’m starting to dread playing with him because it seems like playing always turns into biting. We have also taught him “enough..."

I am of the opinion that the majority of crocheted clothing (with the exception of loose, see-through sundresses and sweaters) only ever looks good in spite of the fact that it’s crocheted, not because of it.

Firstly, during the fingering scene, are we supposed to take the intercutting of the scene of Samuel playing with the dog in the hotel room to mean that she is actually thinking of Samuel while having sex with her husband? And secondly, did you take it to be a happy ending or an unhappy one? My interpretation was (and tell me if you think I'm misreading it) that the inserts of Samuel were supposed to tell us that she's really thinking of him while having sex with her husband and that, while she has now managed to achieve orgasm with her husband, she will forever be doing it while thinking of this other guy and that ..."

Des Moines - Landmark Supreme Court Ruling on Behalf of Student Expression Document Date: February 22, 2019 Tinker v. Des Moines is a historic Supreme Court ruling from 1969 that cemented students’ rights to free speech in public schools. Mary Beth Tinker was a 13-year-old junior high school student in December 1965 when she and a group of students decided to wear black armbands to school to protest the war in Vietnam. The school board got wind of the protest and passed a preemptive ban. When Mary Beth arrived at school on Dec. 16, she was asked to remove the armband and was then suspended. Four other students were suspended as well, including her brother John Tinker and Chris Eckhardt. The students were told they could not return to school until they agreed to remove their armbands.

My dogs are retrieving maniacs; always have been. This is not surprising seeing that we live with Goldens and Tollers. Throw something (literally anything) and they will happily race after it, pick it up, and bring it back to you. We LOVE this about our dogs and they adore playing this game. Cooper. Ball. Pool. Heaven. Pet Peeve Alert So here is my pet peeve. Nothing irritates me more (perhaps other than someone barking commands at my dogs. Ugh.), than a visitor to our home doing the ol’ fake throw with our dogs.

Buddy is a near-constant presence in my life, following me from room to room, lingering underfoot in the kitchen, and cuddling on the couch as I brain rot on reality TV. I wonder if he’s not-so-silently judging me when he sighs and tosses me some side-eye. Is he actually happy here? Does he even like me?..."
