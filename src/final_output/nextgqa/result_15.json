This is how I see the film’s story, I hope my interpretation is how it was intended to be perceived after digesting it and deconstructing it (because once I did this, I thought even better of the film, it’s just that the fractured narrative device takes on a life of its own, which makes it a little daunting for some to sit through the first time): You can say tha..."

But it was a recent post about decisive films that made me think about this again. So...be kind... The Fountain gives us three separate story lines with two actors playing parts in each story. My theory goes to combine all three. First, we get present Izzi's story about Tomas and Queen Isabella. This story is nothing more than a fiction based on the pursuit of the Tree of Life/Fountain of Youth and Conquistadors exploring Central and South America. ..."

If you look up reviews , you’ll be confronted with two extremes: those that thought it was sheer drivel and those that thought it was the one of most incredible film ever. Why such a disparity? Each opinion is a function of how many aspects the viewer appreciated from this multifaceted work. Those that gave it a 1/10 likely did so because they judged it primarily on the story itself (which was basic at its core). Everything else was superfluous or pretentious.

Members Online • gwents_howling Tiếng Việt What does it mean when a cat turns its back to you and sits down in the middle of your interaction? Behavioral I was playing some sort of wand toy with her, she usually doesn’t like playing that with me since she is still scared of me (newly adopted cat). Today, she got intrigued and caught onto the feathers, but immediately released and turned her back to me right after and sat down. She did not walk away like she usually does when she is scared or uncomfortable, she simply turned around and sat. Some articles say it means disapproval, some say it means trust as she ..."

We talked to three cat experts to get the scoop on the most common causes as well as advice on when you should go see your vet about it. Why Is My Ca..."

Cats walking nearby and suddenly flopping over on their back with a wriggle called the social roll, but why do they do it? Like all cat postures, there are subtle variations of meaning but whether it’s a human or animal watching them, it’s a friendly, non-aggressive stance demonstrating comfort. Comfort is a key point. I’ve seen my cats gallivant happily in the rain and snow but not once have they rolled on their back in cold weather. Also, if they are all alone having a dirt bath, I wouldn’t call it a social role since they might be simply scratching an itch. I’..."

This is probably a really basic question, but FH and I are mid-20s and are the first of our friends to get engaged. I've only been to two weddings and he's only been to one, so we don't really know much about weddings yet - though we are learning! Anyway, we are tying to figure out where the bride and groom go after the ceremony. I know that generally you go take pictures, but do you just....disappear? or do you say hello to people first? We are having an outdoor wedding so we won't really be going away...but we also need to take our pictures quickly because we'll be racin..."

When I first started shooting weddings, I really was more of a “traditional” guy: grooms should see their bride for the first time when she walks down the aisle.  It seemed that was what many brides were doing and well, it is what my parents and grandparents did when they got married, and their stories are so inspiring. But then I experienced a shift. Brides were moving toward first looks and I saw what transpired. Confession: Now I am a huge fan of first looks!

Photograph showing the withered arm of Amar Bharati. Image via X. One man’s unwavering spiritual faith has led him to embark on an extraordinary gesture to show his commitment. For over 50 years, Amar Bharati has raised an arm above his head, not once lowering it in the five decades he’s held it in the air.

But I think I just got what it meant for her to \"imagine\" this, right out of her registering to vote for the Good Friday Agreement referendum : it's what she pictures this vote to be. I.e.
