Members Online • [deleted] How come Ethan didn't question or acknowledge the old lady in the wheelchair? (Eveline) Lore question From the very start of RE7, you see the old lady sat down with the baker family looking completely brain dead and yet the bakers do not interact with her at the dinner scene. Throughout the game, you would see her in random parts of the house and even humming after emerging from the basement after defeating Jack, I find this somewhat disturbing as Ethan does not acknowledge Eveline (of course you do as the player) and it's understandable that he doesn't see her as a threat until the very end of course but it is very weird that she is f..."

You know this holiday actually used to be a pagan holiday, celebrated on February 15th? The Catholic Church then took it over, moved the date and named it after St. Valentine, the patron saint of fertility. I’m Stephanie, I’m single, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not too interested in celebrating the patron saint of fertility when I’m 31 years old and more single than Jane Austen.

The premise is very simple: 10 men line up, each with a balloon in their hands, for 1 woman. They pop their balloons, for any reason and at any time, if they don't wish to go on a date with her.

Members Online • YesMan847 why couldnt yao ming just stand in front of the hoop and get the ball passed to him and throw it in? I think he was the tallest in the league at the time. So why couldn't he just stand in front of the hoop, get it passed to him high up. Nobody else can reach that height so he gets it every time. Then he jumps higher than everyone and sky hooks it in.

As a child, Hoop was fascinated with playing basketball but suffered an injury that set him back with his life plans. The film, after this intro, then cuts to Hoop as a grown man, and plays out this way in an almost Moonlight–like manner. Hoop is abstract, in one word, and takes an ethereal, liberal approach to storytelling in its extended takes and moments of quiet, again, much as Moonlight does. Shots play out for quite a bit longer than they normally would in a film, but this is mostly justified as part of dire..."

There’s a quote that goes “if you want to know what someone fears losing, watch what they photograph”. It’s a part of our daily lives, not every image will get big a reaction but it can reveal something about us.

It was a simple shot of a tree on a hill during a golden sunset. Something about the warm light, the bent branches, and the long shadows made me feel calm and nostalgic all at once. As a budding photographer, I wondered: what was it about that image that tugged at my heart? Why do specific photos — whether taken by us or by the greats — resonate deeply, while others feel just meh? It turns out, a lot of it comes down to psychology. Our brains, biases, and emotions greatly influence how we perceive and love certain images. In this article, we’ll explore the psyc..."

Members Online • goodmammajamma Tiếng Việt Clapping on 1 and 3 General Question I'm wondering if anyone can answer this for me. My understanding is that the accepted reason for the stereotype that white people clap on 1 and 3 instead of 2 and 4, is because traditionally, older musical forms weren't based on a backbeat where the snare is on 2 and 4. But my question is, why does this STILL seem to be the case, when music with a 'backbeat' has been king now for many decades? None of these folks would have been alive back then.

Miss Mary Mack: A hand-clapping history Posted on April 18, 2016 by SAHMurai 1 Comment This is part 2 of a 3-part series telling brief histories of popular hand-clapping songs. So (just like in part one, on “Down, down, baby,”), why not start with hip-hop news? It seems Juicy J (feat. Lil Wayne and August Alsina) produced “Miss Mary Mack” just last year. (It took me a full minute to realize he’s singing about weed, and only weed. Must say, I prefer Nelly’s “Country Grammar” sample.) Moving on… Here’s what I’m talking about. The first thing you need to know about “Miss Mary Mack” of schoolyard lore is that she gets around. Kyra Danielle Gaunt writes in The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes from Double-dutch to Hip-hop, that “‘Miss Mary Mack’ is the most common hand clapping game in the English- speaking world, and th..."

Some even twirl their hair while speaking. The habit is highly individualized and can have many meanings. I will start with the most common connotation and then branch out to other meanings that have been ascribed to the gesture. There is some cultural bias in the tendency to manipulate the hair. Of course, you will not see it among women who live in cultures where the head is covered. While the gesture is more commonly observed in women, it can also be practiced by men. For example, I knew one manager who would immediately start to twirl his curly hair in a particular place the moment a conversation took on a tone of visiting or chatting. He did not do it in technical or serious conversation, but the minute things became informal, his finger would start working that spot on his head. The implic..."

Not just in the early months, but also in the womb. It is simply untrue that babies are born Tabula Rasa and are simply shaped by nurture after birth. It is a myth that in the early weeks babies just sleep eat, poo and cry, and are not aware of their surroundings. It is also incorrect that you only need to take care of their physical needs, like feeding, bathing, changing their nappies and creating a comfortable space for them to sleep. They enter the world as sentient beings,..."

This is how your baby lets you know that they’re hungry, uncomfortable, in pain or need comfort. Sometimes your baby will cry for no obvious reason.During the first 3 months, your baby uses their voice and body to communicate. For example, they’ll smile, laugh, make cooing sounds, and move their arms and legs when they’re interested or excited.From around 3 months, you’ll see and hear baby language starting to develop. This happens when you and your child make eye contact, interact and take turns, almost as if you’re having a conversation.After about 9 months of age, your child will let you know they’re interested in something by staring, po..."

As a child my imagination was overcome with stories of creatures that come alive at night and the safety offered by a house and light. I never had anything to base this fear on until a night when I decided to go with a buddy of mine to a baseball game and got stuck at a light at 2 a.m. after dropping him off at home. Of course that night the game went into extra innings and so I didn't get a chance to drop my friend off back home until well after 1 a.m. Everything was fine on the way home unti..."

Weird situation happened to me recently. Me, my wife, my wife's sister N and her boyfriend (all in early 30s) were at our friend's party which took place at her apartment. At one point, when we were a bit drunk (but not so much) I had been sitting on a balcony with N's boyfriend; we had been smoking and having a conversation about some totally irrelevant stuff. Out of the sudden, N enters the balcony, comes over to me and sits on my lap. I thought it was weird, so I immediately proposed bringing additional chair from the apartm..."

Whether it’s a playful tap, a gentle brush against your arm, or an affectionate squeeze, every touch carries a hidden message. Understanding female body language can feel like trying to crack a secret code—but once you know what to look for, you’ll be able to read her interest, comfort, and attraction with confidence.

Go on, give it a go. Surprise! It can't be done. You simply can't convey romantic interest without the body getting into the act. To play a really successful game of flirtation your body must speak what your mouth won't say. If you're feeling good about yourself the way you focus your eyes, position your mouth, and maneuver your shoulders, hips, and hands send out signals that say, 'Check me out! I think you're hot!' After you get your target's attention you shift gears to hold onto his or her interest and move the attraction to another level. Finally, having captured and conquered the unsuspecting, or equally interested party, your body moves into a new mode of behaving that demonstrates comfort, ease, and familiarity. O..."

You might be able to tell if a woman is interested in you just by what she does with her hands, eyes, and posture. It can also be easy to tell when a girl isn't interested. She may close herself off, answer in short sentences, or avoid your gaze.

As a DivorceCare support group facilitator, I’ve heard lots of stories about marriages breaking up. Often the person seeking support in our group did not want the divorce. Obviously, in these cases, they have no choice if the other spouse is determined to end the marriage. But in many instances the person in the failing marriage has been the one to leave, and/or the one to file for divorce, and I’ve found in these cases “Christian guilt” tends to creep in. How do I know God is OK with what I am doing? Is it wrong for me to give up on this marriage? Should I go back to my spouse even though they’re still [fill in the blank]? So what should a faithful Christian do when faced with the decision of whether to divorce their spouse?

Why is he doing drugs? Why is he dropping out of school? Why is he making terrible choices with his life when he has so much potential?” I’ll never forget the mother who said in exasperation one day, “Sometimes I just want to superglue my daughter to the chair until she gets out of her teen years!” The good news is that you have the power to influence your child’s decisions by taking control of yourself—and not your teen.

It kind of looks like how you raise your right hand to swear an oath, but the clenched hand is more like a \"power to the people\" fist from the 1960s. Frankly, it's weird. For the longest time I didn't think anything of it because that's what I did as a cadet, it's what all of us did. But after a few years in the military and inte..."

In fact, it has been suggested that body language makes up 55% of communication, with the other 45% consisting of tone and words.While many nonverbal cues can be interpreted the same way regardless of gender, men often stand, gesture, and use their eyes in specific ways. A man’s body language can provide additional insights into his attitude and feelings that may not be conveyed by his words.
