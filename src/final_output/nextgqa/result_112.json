My now-toddler, by contrast, appears to think of me as his own personal milk-and-cuddles machine. That would explain the look of utter surprise, followed by serious irritation, when my baby sees me kiss my partner. He was not on board with this at all, and like any strong-willed person, he made his displeasure known. At around six or seven months of age, my son would swat at my husband if he tried to touch or kiss me while my son was nursing. By ten months or so, my son would throw a full-on stiff-arm my husband’s way any time he'd try to hug me if he were in my arms, actively pushing us apart. Sorry, Daddy, but you seem not to understand life on Planet Baby. You hug me, or Mama hugs..."
