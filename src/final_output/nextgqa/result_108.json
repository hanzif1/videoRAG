Parents rant and rave about incessant crying or their inability to soothe a cranky babe, but it is definitely more rare to hear a parent gushing over how excited their baby gets. \"My son gets so excited that he squeals with delight when he sees our dog,\" is not a brag you read on social media very often.

While it’s been hinted at throughout our Senate hearing scenes, The Residence’s sixth episode tells us definitively that Cordelia Cupp, the World’s Greatest Detective, does not solve the mystery of A.B. Wynter’s death that first night (and morning) in the White House. But if you were paying attention, there were two things Detective Cupp was always quite clear about: She doesn’t work on anyone else’s timeline, and she always gets the guilty party in the end.
