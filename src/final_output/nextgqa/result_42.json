Covering your ears can make a loud place more bearable. For children with autism, the need to cover their ears may be more prevalent as places that don’t seem loud to neurotypical people may sound loud to them. Children with autism are more inclined to experience sensory sensitivities, especially when it comes to sounds. Covering their ears can help them avoid sensory overload when a room is too loud for their liking.

Behavioral About my cat: 7yo, desexed male, DSH. He is the only cat and pet in the household. He spends most of his time indoors, but does get some outdoor time in the backyard.

A few include slouching, frowning, or giving a weak handshake. But do you know which body language move often gets a pass? Slow walking. I think slow walking is one of the worst traits to have!

Members • yekirati Black plastic thing in new saxophone? Question Hi all! I've been playing on a used horn and recently purchased a brand new one that arrived today. As I was taking the plastic and packaging off of it, I found a black plastic stopper-looking thing shoved in at the top where the neck piece fits. Do I need to keep that or is that just for packaging purposes? My old/used instrument didn't have one when I got it, but the piece of plastic feels rather robust for something that is simply packaging so I figured I'd ask before I tossed it. Thanks!

I want to also thank the sponsor of this video, Sweetwater, our favorite place to buy music gear. Reasons for upgrading your saxophone case When you buy a saxophone, it comes with a case.

This becomes apparent very early on in the novel, “An hour later they were on the road. He pushed the cart and both he and the boy carried knapsacks. In the knapsacks were essential things. In case they had to abandon the cart and make a run for it”(5.) The boy and his father were really forced to have just the bare essentials so that they could ensure safety in case they needed to run from the “bad guys.” This idea of pushing all that you need to survive and just the bare essentials really connected with me. It reminded me of a monologue that I wrote in 7th grade.          “I want a lot of things, like I think we all do.

I am sooo fucking over it. My son (3) will not stop when he’s upset. I try so hard to be calm and tell him we don’t do that and try to redirect behavior but nothing works. I’ve tried talking to him and explaining to him but he just doesn’t care. I even try taking the toys away that he’s throwing but he just picks up another one and throws it. I am at my wits end. Once he’s over his fit he’s fine. He’s his lovable playful self. But I swear to god it’s like a fucking demon posses him and makes him throw and hit constantly. I am at such a loss on what to do.

And, ideally, she wants a reaction.  Naturally, her social skills are a work in progress, and while she’s learning how to engage in play, she’s often misunderstood. Her antics sometimes worry and embarrass her parents and elicit their disapproval. Her toddler peers are all-forgiving (even when they’ve been on the losing end of her toy snatching), but her friends’ parents might be less understanding.

Members • CarlosAssi81 Tiếng Việt中文 (繁體) Crying baby turned blue My 1 month old girl was having a crying episode, she's been fussy all morning and was not able to poop, finally when she did she was crying so much while we were changing her diaper ( probably was hungry by that time) and she turned blue and stopped screaming... Honestly my heart stopped when I saw this... I felt she was going to pass out... What happened? How can we prevent this in the future or what should we do if this happens?
