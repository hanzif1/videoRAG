I’m genuinely curious to know if there’s any parents out there who aren’t allowing their child to use any sort of tablet/iPad/Smartphone and what their experience has been. (By this I mean your kids don’t use any screens including handing them your cell for entertainment during grocery shopping or in the waiting room etc, except for the tv on occasion or for long road trips/flights) How do you feel that it compares to your friends who do use them with their kids? Would you/will you allow them to start using them someday? If..."

Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of ..."

It’s almost embarrassing. 😅 Claire: “Hayley, recently got a little creative on her college application she listed herself as a big sister.” Hayley: “Technically, I am a big sister” Phil: “She even capitalised the B and the S” Claire: “Which makes sense, because it was.” I think I got this joke after watching the episode at least more than five times.

Behavioral Issue He's a 3 month old - loves to play, never afraid of any other toys and quite a sport. From his body language of running away whenever I dangle this toy (and runs to a box or corner) I am not sure if he is playfully running away or scared? if I roll this wool ball on the floor he loves chasing it but if I dangle it as I did on the video he just runs away (used to previously playfully paw it when toy was dangled) Read more Share New to Reddit?

So when we do, we want to sit in comfort. This fine Saturday morning I am taking my family to a birthday party at the zoo. I got up, cleaned out the car, fed everyone breakfast, packed the car, changed the very wiggly baby, and now I’m taking this ten minutes before we leave to recline back in the chair, cat on my chest, and my ass is not moving. Have a great weekend my fellow dads. I hope you have a comfortable chair or at least a favorite spot on the couch you get to sit in it this weekend. Read more Share New to Reddit?

But I think I have found something that lies at the bounds of her good nature. That something has good bones, lanky arms, big feet, plays the strong, silent type and is there to cushion the falls of family members. It’s getting old and could really use some new threads. It was once reasonably fashionable but now just looks a bit tired and soft in the middle. No, I am not talking about me, though the descriptors are worryingly apt. I’m talking about a sofa.

The other leaves – a few – that are on your own twig are intimately close to you. With them you share your deepest affections. A great affinity and proximity also unites you to the leaves of the nearest branch, with which you share the belonging to a slightly larger branch. You are still there, but not as much as the leaves of your own twig are. And, as all the oth..."

Flirting tends to come with sometimes aggravatingly subtle cues, making it hard to know if all your eyelash-batting is being reciprocated.Consider me, who believed for months that I’d all but flashed in neon “Signs a Girl Likes You” at the person I’m now dating. Before writing this, I asked him when he was sure I liked him. His response? The first time I leaned over (with fish taco breath) and kissed him.

Sometimes, medium to larger dogs will lean on their humans as a way of winning your attention or affection. This is their version of a hug. You can \"hug\" them back by leaning on them! Dogs, by nature, are social pack animals. Naturally, they crave physical closeness to their pack members, and you are one of them! Smaller dogs can achieve this closeness by being picked up or lazing about on their humansâ€™ laps, but such luxuries cannot always be afforded to larger dogs. In order to have that social closeness, big dogs tend to lean on the legs of their humans.

Members Online • staralfur92 Tiếng Việt What is the point of baby swings if they can't sleep in them? Discussion I'm currently pregnant with baby number 4, after a 6 year break. When I started making my registry this time around I realized that a few of my previous must-haves are now off the market completely. Namely, the Rock n Play which I've now learned is a death trap.

Members Online • JetstarA320 Foot Tapping and Head Nodding when playing Question I don't understand how tapping or nodding your head (or feel it in your body) on the beat works when you are tried to play in time. When you tap your foot or nod your head are you subconsciously syncing your playing with the beat or do you have to think about your foot tapping/nodding like a metronome trying to match its time? When I play I find that when I tap me foot it's not in sync with my playing sometimes, so is the foot tapping like telling you when the beats are and I try my best ..."

It is worth pointing that out as we watch his extended humiliation over the last week and the next five (five!) more weeks to come. Because if he was even a slightly sympathetic person, it might be painful to watch what is happening to him. But he not an admirable man. He is an unprincipled technocrat without the basic competence that tag would suggest. He is the management consultant brought in by failing management, because they know he won't make them look bad in comparison.

Townsend & Son,” is embarking on a closer look at the three more common types of pastry crusts used in 18th century cookery: the standing crust, the puff paste, and the short crust (also known as the common paste or cold paste). Pastry crusts were foundational to a great many 18th century dishes. Our second video installment (above) focuses on the puff paste. I am also including an 18th century recipe for beef pasties at the end of this post. Puff pastry was a very popular form of pastry crust in the 18th century.

How else are you supposed to stand? Like you're riding a skateboard? edit: thanks guys! just to clarify i actually don't ride skateboards, i was just thinking that skateboarders kind of bend their knees, and i was wondering if i was supposed to stand more like that Read more Archived post.

Members Online • Beggarsfeast Bottle Cleaning If you have a bottle that has some fuzz or funk inside, but it’s hard to clean, like a growler, and you don’t have a brush that will work, use coarse sea salt. After soaking in hot water and soap, rinse out the bottle and then pour in a few tablespoons of coarse salt. Add just enough cold water to make a slurry.

I hope you all had a great week-end. I had several hours all to myself on Friday (never happens!) and cleaned like a crazy woman. I vacuumed and steam-cleaned rugs. I scrubbed bathrooms and I organized the kitchen. Yay me!! I know you all know how good that feels. Saturday’s reward was a morning spent in Saratoga Springs with my sweet husband. We took a walking tour of Congress Park, popped into the Saratoga Springs History Museum, and ate a delicious lunch at Boca Bistro. What, no shopping you say?!! That’s right, no shopping, but that does not mean there wil..."

Members Online • ego_nazgul 中文 (繁體) Watching TV around newborn? Our child is 10 days old. My wife and I are in complete agreement that there will be no screen time until the age of 2, but she’s also pretty adamant about literally not having TV on in the same room until the age of 2, because of the noise, because of some studies showing that background noise from TVs can impact language development, etc. The way I’ve read those studies, it’s more focused on noise from the TV in the background when you’re interacting with the child, not so much that it’s an issue to have it on when they’re asleep (on you, etc), in the same room. Ultimately, it’s been a bit of a tou..."

This video will show how to feel where the baby is within the uterus. Let the mother know that you would like to check her belly to find out the position of her baby. Be sure she has emptied her bladder then ask her to lie on her back. There are four maneuvers that are done in sequence.

By nick on Tue, 01/16/2024 - 13:35 Image Read any FaceBook group or Reddit subreddit that is devoted to kayaking or canoeing, you will inevitably come across a discussion about wearing a life jacket (aka PFD (Personal Flotation Device) or BA (Buoyancy Aid)) at some point. Often someone will post a picture from a paddling trip or something and the person in the picture isn't wearing a lifejacket. Some safety Nazi will point out that it is really grossly irresponsible to model such unsafe behavior in such a public space. I don't know that these attempts to police proper conduct do anything to actually make anyone safer.
