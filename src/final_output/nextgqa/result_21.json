Members Online • MirrorMan22102018 My cat always wants to be near me, even after he has eaten, been brushed and/or has otherwise had his daily needs met. Is he trying to tell me something? Behavioral There are lots of days where, even after my cat's needs have been addressed, he still wants to be near me all the time. When he isn't say, rubbing his body against my shins or wandering around me, he often rests on my bed, rests on the floor while in proximity to me, and seems to overall want to always be near me. Every time he is near me, he is purring. Suggesting he is content, yet he wants to always be near me...."

Members Online • Repulsive_Fig233 Stray cat circling me: what does this mean? Video The cat in our parking lot always comes and circles around my feet. I looked it up and apparently it ‘imprinted’ on me? I’m not sure if that’s what it means for sure though, because it doesn’t really rub me. As you can see in the video it circles around me, pauses, and circles back. Does that mean anything? Recently it keeps meowing when it sees me, is that it’s way of greeting me? Can someone tell me what it means? Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share New to Reddit? Create your account and connect wit..."

Spoilers false I was just rewatching GOT until I watched the scene about the unsullied killing newborn babies. Just wondering, did grey worm also kill a newborn baby? Sounds like something that should've been brought up in the TV show, but there was way more significance given to the fact that he was castrated. I haven't read the books, so if there's something else in the books let me know. Read more Share New to Reddit? Create your account and connect with a world of communities. Continue with Emai..."

This is my first post here after lurking for a while. My 9 month old son, when excited or very upset, will rotate his wrists (+/- ankles) around repetitively and sometimes flaps his arms. He doesn’t do it at all when he’s relaxing, occupied or playing. We went out to eat as a family tonight and when the waitress came to check on our table while we were feeding our son some mashed potatoes, she leaned down and said to us “my son used to make exactly the same hand movements, he was dia..."

And made a plan to kill the man who framed him. Richard Phillips survived the longest wrongful prison sentence in American history by writing poetry and painting with watercolors. But on a cold day in the prison yard, he carried a knife and thought about revenge. By Thomas Lake, CNNVideo by Matthew Gannon, CNNPhotographs by Brittany Greeson for CNN Richard Phillips is a tall man with broad shoulders and a habit of singing to himself, usually without words, a deep and joyful sound that seems to rise from his soul. He began singing when he was a boy, and kept singing in prison, and now sings in the car, and at the dinner table, sustaining that one long note, as if nothing in the world could stop the music. Two days after he was sentenced to life in prison in 1972, Phillips wrote a poem. It may have been the first poem he ever wrote. He was ..."

To bury one’s head in the sand is to ignore or deny the existence of a problem in the hope it will eventually go away. But despite this well-known idiom, which has been in use since Roman times, ostriches do not in fact bury their heads in the sand.However, it is more than likely that the phrase has some link to these flightless birds. In the past, people who observed ostriches that appeared to bury their heads in the sand thought they did so to avoid predators. The idea was that an ostrich is so stupid that if it hid its head in the sand so it couldn’t see a predator, the predator wouldn’t be able to see them. This would of course b..."

Reading Time min Since Ancient Roman times, people have been spreading the rumour that ostriches get so panicked when faced with danger that they react by stuffing their heads in the dirt. This idea is so prominent throughout history, that these large birds have become synonymous with people who refuse to face their problems head on. However, in this day and age, the rumour that ostriches stick their heads in the sand has been proven to be a myth.So where did this misconception come from?Scientists have a few ideas. The first thing to consider is that ostriches have small heads relative to the size of their body. So, when they bring their heads close to the ground to nibble at the grass, they may look like they are disappearing entirely. Also, ostriches don’t build nests for their eggs. Instead, they dig holes in the sand to keep their e..."

Our son, is a very happy toddler but lately when he gets angry he will hit me and my husband in the face. We have a dog who he just loves so we are always telling him to “pat her gently”. So when he hits us we typically say, in a kind and firm manner, “we touch mommy gently.” Sometimes I add, “mommy touches you gently.” I usually grab his hand to stop him from hitting me. He hasn’t hit any other kids or family members other than me and my husban..."

They either go to one extreme and yell, threaten, restrain, or even spank the child, or they go to the other extreme and give in. In both cases, the parent may stop the meltdown, but they haven’t taught their child to behave more appropriately. And the next time their child is uncomfortable, he or she will simply throw another tantrum. In my experience, parents are very resistant to the idea of their kids being unhappy or uncomfortable. They learn what their child has taught them: if you make me uncomfortable, I’m going to make you uncomfortable. When a child ..."

By Teju ColeJuly 18, 2012 He is unknown. No name, no profession, no identifying details, but he looks out with the calm sternness of one who knows his place in the world. And because of this calmness, this sternness—the skeptical gaze and tight lips—we suspect it might be an image of the artist himself. Self-portraits of artists often present them with a certain forthrightness, which is necessary because the status of artists is always uncertain—this was true in the 15th century, and it is true now. And so, in their portraits of themselves, artists show confidence, worldliness, and a measure of pride in being artists. Worldliness: the artist is Jan van Eyck, the portrait was pa..."

A translation of the text into modern English by Catherine Batt was published in 2014 by ACMRS (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies). The painting is housed at the National Gallery, London. The NG’s website provides a high-res image, some key facts and a brief description. Wikipedia also publishes a page with details, particularly about the inscription on the frame of the painting.It’s very likely Van Eyck possessed or had access to a copy of this book that can be described as a literary form of confession and..."

Post navigation ← Previous Next → When England reluctantly adopted the fork Posted on March 5, 2021 by Ellen Hawley Although you can still find Britons who measure other people’s intelligence, level of civilization, and general acceptability by whether they use a fork and knife in the approved manner (and of course there’s only one), the fork first arrived in Britain to the sound of mockery and jeering. Unlike the knife and the spoon, the fork doesn’t seem to be one of those things early humans felt a strong urge to invent. According to the Smithsonian website, prehistoric humans made spoons out of shells or wood depending what was on hand. Forks, though? A few ..."

Dogs’ Responses to Affection from Familiar and Unfamiliar People - January 16, 2013 Dogs prefer to be petted on the side of their chest or under the chin, not on the top of the head, paws, or back legs--and it makes a difference who is doing the petting. Photo: Ksenia Raykova/Shutterstock By Zazie Todd, PhD When my Siberian husky wants affection, he will come and stand near me. If I don’t respond immediately, he will lick his lips and move closer, possibly leaning on me, until I respond. Sometimes when I start to pet him, he will lick his lips again, but if I take this as a sign that he’d like me to stop, he licks his lips even more a..."

Effects of human-dog familiarity on dogs’ behavioural responses to petting. Applied Animal Behaviour Sciences 142, 176-181. Humans communicate effectively with dogs through many channels, including visual (gazing, gestures), sound (whistles, barks, words), and touch (petting).  People often show affection by petting or holding the dog, but physical contact can mean something different when dogs communicate with one another.  Contact is typically used to maintain existing relationships among familiar dogs, or to challenge or threaten a potential—often unfamiliar—rival. In this study, Kuhne et al. wanted to see if dogs react differently when petted by familiar and unfamiliar people. Many studies have demonstrated that petting a dog has positive effects on the person’s physiology and immune system.  For some dogs petting may be a positive reinforcer, ..."

Not all dogs like to be patted, at least not all of the time. Dogs have preferences as to where, when and how they like to be touched. They also have preferences for who they like to be touched by. Just because they love a chest scratch from their care giver, doesn’t mean they want the same from a stranger. Even in the same household a dog may enjoy a particular interaction from one member of the family, but not from a different member. The good news is that it’s easy to ask a dog if they like the way you’re touching the..."

Pat them on the head! After all, it’s the closest body part within reach and those puppy dog eyes are irresistible. It’s also a gesture of fondness for us. But while we might stroke someone’s hair or cheek to show them we love them, dogs don’t speak the same love language as us. They’d likely far prefer we show our affection in a different way. Still, teaching your dog to tolerate head pats will go a long way to helping them cope with this unwelcome human interaction. Why Dog..."

Some last an appropriate amount of time and some last longer than they should. Many children will cease to use oral habits that are no longer appropriate by themselves and others will need help from their parents. Today’s discussion will focus on the most common oral habits seen in young children and their possible effects (positive and negative).Common oral habits in children consist of mouth breathing, pacifier use and thumb sucking.  As a speech-language pathologist I have seen children with a wide variety of these oral habits. I have targeted therapy goals related to mouth breathing and an open mouth posture as well as counselled parents on pacifier use and thumb su..."
