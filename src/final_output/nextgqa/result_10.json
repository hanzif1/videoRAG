Question false So I watched the movie for the first time a few days ago. I really enjoyed it and regret not giving it a watch sooner than that.

He breaks his arm with the bone sticking out, bribes kids to give them their shirt for a sling and to buy their silence and walks off before the ambulance/police comes. That's the last we see of him. What's the point of that scene...."

Members Online • AStrangerSaysHi Can anyone help me find the etymology for the AAVE phrase \"to put one's foot in it\" as a compliment to one's cooking? For anyone not familiar, in Southern African-American cultures, a highly regarded compliment to the chef would be to exclaim that he \"put his foot in\" the dish. The closest I have found for a coherent etymology was someone who posited that it expands from the phrase \"to dip one's toe in\" something.

I must have a strange expression on my face, because he looked at me and asked me what was wrong. Of course he did not know that in Japan, what he just did would be considered to be terribly rude, in the same way that someone who didn't grow up in Europe might not know about not putting your elbows on the table.

A player, on the field of play, was drinking from a bottle of water, the ball came to him, he passed it to a Colleague, the Referee did not stop the game. After the game I advised that the Player should have received a yellow Card for Unsporting conduct and a free kick be awarded to his Opponents.

When I had just discovered the ballet world for myself, I was terribly conscious that I had missed the great days of Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rudolph Nureyev, and had even lost out on the star of British ballet, Anthony Dowell.

Half-melted ice cream, lipstick, boyfriends and anything a girl can own have been wrapped with pink bows all over the “for you page” on TikTok since early December 2023 without any sensible explanation. What is this trending bow telling us?Ribbons have been used since before the 11th century for holding objects together. In the 21st century, however, the use of ribbons has expanded to serve decorative purposes. Its presence has had a foothold in the fashion industry ever since.

In total, 51,660 bows are displayed, representing the number of substantiated sexual abuse cases against young girls reported annually to national Child Protection Services agencies.As visitors make their way through the gallery space—maneuvering through the panels like navigating a maze—an audio component pulls them deeper into the experience.

Other examples can include telling a child to leave, or worse, to get out of your face, calling him names or telling the child that he is worthless, making a child the family scapegoat or blaming him for family/sibling problems.

Sometimes it’s a toddler who fell down the stairs after slipping past the baby gate. Sometimes it’s a small child who fell out of bed during a restless night’s sleep. And older kids can play a little too hard and take a spill, especially when they start running around a favorite kids’ spot like Como Regional Park in St. Paul or Hyland Play Area in Bloomington. Most of the time, any minor bumps, cuts and bruises are the only sign that your child’s excitement got the best of them for a moment.

The majestic wolfhound, the oldest Irish breed was once a status symbol owned only by Kings and as their names suggests, used for hunting the wolves that once roamed our country. So, it is no surprise that with our close relationship with the hound, that it finds a prominent place in our Folklore, myths and legends.
