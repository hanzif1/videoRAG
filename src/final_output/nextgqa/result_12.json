Pretty much everybody else likes to scream in the microphones, and it seems that I can't do much to prevent it from peaking like crazy. ..."

And many beginners are shocked by how weird their voice sounds when amplified. But here’s the thing: Learning how to sing with a microphone is just as important as learning proper vocal technique. Why? Because what’s the point of developing an amazing voice if no one can hear you? Or worse, if the microphone makes your voice sound bad? The truth is, microphone technique is one of the most overlooked aspects of becoming a great singer.

She loves any smart tip that makes parenting less of a slog.The time I felt most judged as a parent happened just after my third child was born.

If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it tonight. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything, except of course, personal fear,and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital `severe tea' at Robin Hood's Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shocked the `New Woman' with our appetites.Men are more tolerant, bless them!

More than a quarter of new mothers have fallen asleep recently while feeding their babies, putting the infants at increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), research from the School of Medicine reveals. More than 80% had not intended to fall asleep, and many had chosen to feed in chairs or on sofas rather than in a bed. Unfortunately, the cushions and confines of those locations can be very unsafe for babies, raising the risk of death by 49 to 67 times. The researchers, with UVA ..."

September 29, 2022 Nicole The Western flute used to be considered a masculine instrument, but it’s now one of the most feminine.  Why is that, and when did the gender association change? I spent my first year after graduating from college working at a family-owned music shop.  During rental season, my coworkers and I would sometimes try to guess what instrument new band students would choose when they came in for a rental.  One day, a boy walked in wearing one of those bright, multicolored hats with a spinning propeller on top, and I thought instantly, “that kid’s gonna play the trumpet.”  So I was totally surprised when he asked for a flute instead. I spent the next half hour introducing him to the instrument and walking his parents through a renta..."

In a nutshell, the phrase meant that a human being was supposed to be well rounded, by practicing a variety of arts. Remember, we are talking about a time and a place in history when the capabilities of the human being were exalted above all else — that’s humanism, or “belief in humans” — and what better way to exemplify the awesomeness of humans than to be good at bunch of different things? I mean, what other species can say that? Now, if playing the flute is a good thing, what could be wrong with playing it really well? If a person played the flute “too well,” that would mean that he must b..."

Like other kinds of cat aggression, food aggression can be motivated by anxiety, but is unique in that it is specifically focused on food and mealtimes. Cats who aggressively guard their food, constantly search and beg for food, and become overwhelmingly aggressive when anyone approaches their food or food dish may hiss, growl or bite in response. These behaviors can be alarming and even dangerous to other members of the family, but can be treated through several techniques aimed at dealing with the causes behind them. Get a free pet insurance quote in less than 60 seconds!Easily compare quotes from the most trusted pet insurance companies in the United States.Get a quote Symp..."

Why Does My Cat Growl? by Rachel (Wyoming) Hi there - hoping you can help with something that’s been stressing me out. My cat, Shadow, is about 3 years old, and lately she’s been growling a lot. I always thought growling was something dogs did, but Shadow does it too - and not just once in a while. Sometimes she’ll growl when I try to move her off the couch, or when I walk past her while she’s eating.The other day she was sitting in the window and started growling at nothing - at least nothing I could see. I’ve had cats all my life, but none have ever been this vocal in a scary way. I..."

My daughter lives in an apartment in Boston with her exuberant Labrador, three roommates, and now a little gray cat named Ash. Ash is a one-year-old cat who has been passed around a few times in her short life, before landing in this loving home. She sent me a video of little Ash, who is a bit too skinny, but was greedily munching from her overflowing food bowl, and simultaneously purring from all the petting she was getting from roommates who were so excited to meet their new housemate.

I mean, I liked the trial, and loved when Natalia walked in to justify, and how everyone seemed (semi)happy again at the ending sequence, but I also think the series could have explained many things just sooo much better. Many answers of questions that deserved screen time, were just left for the watcher to figure out from context or forgotten about all together. I also found the juxtaposition between Chiara's en Ludo's ending a bit too big. Like Ludo gets as an ending this amazing life in Paris where all her wrongs have been forgotten, ..."

Woman, curly blonde, middle aged, seemed like dutch/german or maybe scandinavian, I think most od the shorts are filmed in a house. Every short starts with her taking a deep breath, in order to start talking. So the video is basically someone going through the shorts, waiting for her to take in a breath and then going to the next short. Very stupid and funny. Read more Locked post.

The atmosphere and suspense was done well, but I was wondering the whole movie if the ending would be worth the wait and unfortunately I don’t feel it was. (Spoilers)****** I had a feeling the whole movie that the guy in the window was going to be the spider. Feel like this has become a trope in movies now.

Got caught in a flash storm in my 2018 Audi A4, accidentally went through a puddle that ended up being much deeper than I expected. Immediately warning lights came on saying tire pressure monitor, auto start/stop, and pre sense were not functional. Car was driving fine however, and no engine light, so I decided to keep driving home as I was only 10 minutes away. Towards the end of the drive, the check engine light flicked on and off for about 1 second and I noticed a very brief drop in power, but then resolved immediately. Then again about 3 minutes later it happened again, but again only for a quick second. Back at home, I turned off the car and opened ..."

Halve it to get -3. Step 2: **Square the halved coefficient** Square the halved coefficient: (-3)^2 = 9. Step 3: **Rewrite the expression** Rewrite the expression as f^2 - 6f + 9 - 9 + 7. Step 4: **Factor the perfect square trinomial** Factor f^2 - 6f + 9 as (f - 3)^2. Step 5: **Combine constants** Combine -9 and +7 to get -2.

Hardware sysrqt August 30, 2017, 11:32am 1 I recently received the Librem 15 in the post and I’m very happy with it. The laptop seems to come with some sort of screen protector layer affixed. This layer has some air bubbles in it, as shown in the photo (bubble on bottom right corner near contents of /dev, smaller bubble higher up, a couple of others not shown). Is this screen protector intended as a permanent layer? I very gently tried pulling at a corner but it didn’t come off, so I assume it is permanent - but how do I get the air bubbles out if so? photo58505974545657143141280×1280 179 KB 2 Likes nicole.faerber August 30, 2017, 11:50am 2 Hi Katy, I am happy that you are happy with your new Laptop The screen foil is not for permanent usage, it is only for protection during production and transport...."
