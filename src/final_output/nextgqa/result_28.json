Yeah, I was too before my first trip. Here, I’ve detailed everything I can think of to help you plan what to pack, all while being respectful, comfortable, and at ease. I was a little nervous about travelling to Saudi Arabia. Not for any of the usual (often incorrect) reasons people might be fearful of travelling to the vast Gulf nation. It was purely because the country felt like such an unknown. Specifically, to be visiting there as a woman and what the Saudi Arabia dress code meant..."

Yes, actually. The answer comes as a surprise to most people, but the additional bit of rope raises it high enough off the ground for our eyes to easily discern it, and our feet to easily trip over. That fact might seem trivial, but the early 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that this chasm between human intuition and physical reality revealed something important about the fallibility of our thinking. After all, if something that seems obvious to almost everyone can be..."

Members Online • OBI-WAN37 Do the physics of Spider-Man swinging down a street between buildings make sense? Hi, I've loved Spider-Man for as long as I can remember, but something's bugging me. If you shot a \"web\" towards a building and it attached at a high point on the building's side, it is inevitable that you will not swing forward, but towards the building instead. The only exception of this is that you could use forward momentum in order to counteract that and actually swing forward, however you would need a large amount of momentum in order to do so. If you were as strong as Spider-Man (which is being able to lift 10-20 tons), would you be able to generate enough forward momen..."

Younger children convince the parent to occupy the rear seat by crying and screaming while driving. Some new moms and dads consciously decide to travel in the back seat, together with the baby. Where does this decision come from and why you should change your habits? Contents:Why is it worth sitting in the front seat?Do you choose the rear or the front seat?Some parents believe that thanks to this, in times of danger, such as choking, or just after the baby wakes up from a nap, their closeness will ensure the baby’s safety and comfort. We understand this, but at the same time we encourage you to look at this topic from a slightly broader perspective. According to the latest research, more than 50% of parents travel with their child in the rear seat. Wh..."

I’ve been paying taxes for a long time. Obviously, I’ve yet to experience my own death, but I have had people close to me die. The drinking traditions that accompany the death of a loved one are interesting to me. My family, friends and I have often celebrated by drinking after a funeral or in memory of the person that died. Usually we are reminiscing about things the person who passed had done or funny stories of our times with them. I guess that’s our own tradition and one I know most people do. I’d also heard the term “pour one out”. I don’t know where or how that phrase started and realized that there are probably many more traditions around death and drinking so I figured I’d do some research. Pour One Out To p..."

It is probable that some dystocia cases are classified as incomplete cervical dilation but merely represent over-zealous interference during early first stage labour. Typically, the opening is only 5-10 cm in diameter which may just allow passage of one hand.

SLAUGHTERING PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES 6.1 Forms of Slaughter Slaughter methods prevailing throughout the world are governed either by tradition, ritual or legislation depending upon the people and the country. In essence, the methods relate to the manner in which the animal is killed and bled and to some extent dressing and handling prior to use as food. Ritualistic or religious slaughter often requires the animal to be in a state of consciousness at the time it is bled. This is characteristic of Jewish (Kosher), Sikh (Jhatka) and orthodox Islamic (or Halal) slaughters. Some cultures in Africa and Asia also slaughter animals in the conscious state although these do not necessarily carry ritualistic connotations. Where a complete state of unconsciousness is rendered prior to bleeding the process is known as humane slaughtering. Under such practice, the state of unconsciousness and accompanying painlessness is effecte..."

He's 4mo + one week. Can't seem to find anything online about this behavior, but I'm worried it might be some neck issue? maybe he is uncomfortable?

I saw The Grey over the weekend and I was very surprised at how much I liked it. I saw the trailer and thought it would be a mindless action movie where Liam Neeson beats up wolves.

It had a covered porch with polished branch pillars. There were windows of blown glass that were as clear as a pond in winter.

Kimberly Nicole Douglas learnt it the hard way when she quickly realised that having no job and no money was only part of the problem. “[I] began reaching out to photographers to see if they were willing to collaborate. Some said they were down but would stop responding when I was trying to confirm a date,” she said on Twitter. After applying to 15 modelling agencies with no luck, Kimberly decided to go a different route. “I did shoots in every room of my house, no tripod so I used a ladder, no camera so I used my phone.

I was only ten when it first came out, but I remember watching it on VHS when I was a young teen. My older sister had recorded it from HBO, along with The Breakfast Club, The Outsiders, and St. Elmo’s Fire. It was a splendid introduction to the Brat Pack.I had forgotten how good the film is. Obviously, the nostalgia factor contributed to my enjoyment this time. But the casting, themes, relationships, and performances were completely engaging. Jon Cryer was born to be Duckie, and the interplay between him and Andie was perfect. I alternately wanted cheer for and yell at B..."

Sixteen Candles seems to have more of a cult following, while The Breakfast Club is more critically-acclaimed. But ever since I was 14 years old (in 1999 – I’m not exactly an 80s child) watching Pretty In Pink on cable television for the first time, that movie stood out to me above the others as the best and most satisfying film. Why it is better than SC and TBC to me is another post for another day, but I think part of the reason PIP is sometimes considered lesser than those is because of its controversial ending. The plot is centered around a love triangle between Andie Walsh (Rin..."

How does it do that? By telling an emotive, all-too-relatable tale of feeling isolated, but telling it via the medium of people dancing in their underwear. The song would have been a big hit anyway – something which, unfortunately, tragedy had something to do with, as we’ll soon see – and was just as huge a success on radio, so it’s not like it’s all about the flesh on show.

Why? Because, despite our best intentions we often misunderstand what parrots really need from us socially. And then, we do the wrong things. We take all that we know about living with other companion animals and attempt to apply this to life with parrots. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work. Parrots are too different. They are prey animals, not predators. Most are not yet domesticated, while our dogs, cats and bunnies are. A parrot’s social needs are more closely aligned with the wild life than with captive life.

So how do you know what your feathered friend is thinking and feeling? Reading bird body language, from head bobbing to sounds to flapping wings, can help you to not only understand what your pet is feeling, but also develop a stronger bond with them. Some actions can even tell you when they’re sick or injured. We spoke with two pet bird experts to decode parrot body language, from physical movements to vocalizations: Dr. Karen Rosenthal, DVM, director of exotic companion animal education for Veterinary Emergency Group in New York City. Dr. Laurie Hess, DVM, an avian and exotic pet veterinarian and owner of the Veterinary Center for Birds and Exotics in Bedford Hills, New York. How D..."

My closest sibling, Jamey, is ten years older than I am. I asked my mother once when I was old enough to figure things out if I was an accident. She smiled and said no, more of an afterthought. It was an apt description, I suppose. My parents were already expecting Clyde when they got married, but the marriage happened quickly enough that no one questioned it. They were madly in love, two free spirits pursuing acting careers in New York, trying to live the fantasy while bringing up an infant. They probably had a little help from the parents, but they also supplemented their as-yet nonexistent acting careers by working side jobs, mom as a waitress in the famous Edison Hotel coffee shop, and dad as a bartender at Charlie's, a well-known ..."
