She is allowed to run along the pavement outside their house to meet him coming home from work in the evening. In the summertime she sometimes runs in her nightie, its pale folds catching around her knees. But now it's winter — November, maybe. The soles of the shoes are curved around the branch of a tree at the bottom of their garden. She tips back her head as far as it will go. The foliage rustles and thrashes. Her father's voice swears. She feels a shout welling like tears in her throat, then the coarse orange rope lowers itself, slightly coiled like a cobra from the branches. `Got it?'

After all, they seem to like it so much. When we help our babies walk, they are gleefully entertained — enjoying us enjoying them — while we’re getting a preview of one of life’s major milestones.

Hey r/movies I was watching Sucker Punch again hoping to get a better grasp of it (also I really like the music). I think I finally got it figured out but was wondering if anyone else would do some discussion with me to get more opinions (I'll post my understanding in the comments). I know this is far from the most popular movie out there for a number of reasons, and you're entitled to your opinion, but I'm kinda hoping there will be at least one person out there who will be able to chat about it.

I live in a touristy place in the UK and most people walk the same regardless if their European, American, Arab or from Africa. For whatever reason young Chinese women mostly seem to walk in this odd way where they avoid any knee movement whatsoever while exaggerating their feet motion and it really sticks out.

She stopped outside and felt a shiver of pleasure and desire run through her. For this was the coat she had always wanted. There wasn’t another one like it, she thought, running her eyes over the other coats hanging from the metal rack or delicately draped over a brocade sofa. It was rare, unique; she had never seen such a color, golden, with a coppery sheen, and so bright it looked as if it were on fire.

It's natural to focus on your baby's birth while you're pregnant. But it's a good idea to also know what to expect after labour.Skin-to-skin contact really helps with bonding. It's a good idea to have your baby lifted onto you as soon as they're born and before the cord is cut so you can be close to each other straight away.Either before, or just after the cord is clamped, your baby will be dried and then covered with a towel to stop them getting cold. You can continue to hold and cuddle your baby while this is done.Your baby may have some of your blood on their skin and perhaps vernix, the greasy white substance that protects your baby's skin in the womb.If you prefer, you can ask the mid..."

I am so cold and wet through,” called a little child outside. It was crying and knocking at the door, whilst the rain was pouring down and the wind was rattling all the windows. “Poor creature!” said the poet, and got up and opened the door. Before him stood a little boy; he was naked, and the water flowed from his long fair locks.

Your baby still puts most things into their mouth too.Your baby is getting a lot of practice at picking up things. And by around 7 months, your baby will have well-coordinated eye-hand movements. This means they can use their fingers to catch and drag objects towards them.Crawling, rolling or shuffling are all ways your baby might be moving around. Your baby can sit on their own and might also pull themselves up onto their knees or even onto their feet to stand.At this age, your baby love..."

So I have no clue why, but recently probably once or twice a week for maybe the last month I just randomly see a black cat out of the corner of my eye that seems to just be gone when I look at where it just was. I’m assuming it’s a cat as it’s typically much shorter than a dog normally would be and seems to be a similar size. What’s prompting me to post this is it just happened again in my room and the only animals in my house are my girlfriends hamsters and my fish. I saw it where my si..."

Story by Richard Barnum. Blackie was a cat. Now that I have told you this much I think you can guess why that was her name. It was because she was as black as a coal, or a bit of tar from the barrel which stood on the street when the men were fixing the roof. Blackie did not have so much as a speck, or a single hair, of white in her glossy coat of fur, and on a dark night, if you were to look for Blackie I think you would not have found her. For she looked just like a bit of the dark itself. When you first looked at Blackie you might have thought she was just like other cats, but she was not. She was a very smart cat, and so many things happened to her, and she had so many adventures, that I am going to tell you about them. Once upon a time, not so very many years ago, Blackie lived in a fine large house with a little boy a..."

But as my canoe club paddles along the river, we’re always looking out for our clear favorites: the mother ducks with a fluffy cluster of ducklings tagging along behind. When they’re lingering at the shore, it all looks slightly chaotic, with baby birds dawdling and exploring as the mother duck keeps an eye on them. But when it’s time to move on, chaos shifts into order as the ducklings line up behind the adult and the convoy moves o..."
