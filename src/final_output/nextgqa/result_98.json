I take a bottle of water and pour it (with an angle 90° ↓) onto the ground. With 90° down, logically the falling water will completely block any air from entering the bottle but I can see bubbles of water going into the bottle.

The ideas developed throughout her long career as both film theorist and filmmaker have cast a long shadow, continuing to influence a host of other thinkers and makers, many of whom appear in this journal. At present, she is professor of film and media studies at Birkbeck, University of London.

Cats walking nearby and suddenly flopping over on their back with a wriggle called the social roll, but why do they do it? Like all cat postures, there are subtle variations of meaning but whether it’s a human or animal watching them, it’s a friendly, non-aggressive stance demonstrating comfort. Comfort is a key point. I’ve seen my cats gallivant happily in the rain and snow but not once have they rolled on their back in cold weather. Also, if they are all alone having a dirt bath, I wouldn’t call it a social role since they might be simply scratching an itch. I’..."

Eating, you can hold off for a few days, pooping is optional (for a while anyway), but peeing is right up there with breathing on the list of things you just gotta do each and every day. So when something happens to stem the flow of pee, trouble ensues - and fast. Pee is a funny little substance. It actually has lots of good stuff in it.
