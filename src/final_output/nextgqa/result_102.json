Moves to not do, harder to maintain frame? Simply looking to share experiences with leads who are under or barely over 5'5. I know some will share their experience with taller follows but even though let's say you're 5'9 and the follow is taller, I believe the dynamics are very different from those between a lead who is 5'5 and below since, in my opinion, things such as bone density, weight, and the like play a significant influence. But I don't have a short, stocky frame, rather, I'm more of a short runner type. So things such as stand on..."

In recent folklore, it's become a death omen. Thanks largely to British urban legends. This urban legend carried over apparently into the Harry Potter book series, where it was a suspected death omen. Harry Potter, a over marketed kids book with elitist undertones and no literary value, but to each their own. There are roughly two black dog types in folklore. The first being the Fairfolk, and the second being demonic (hell hound). It's note worthy that in some folklore the Fairfolk and demons are one in the same ..."

Opinions differ as to the origin of the word ‘Shuck’. It may derive from the Old English word scucca meaning ‘demon’ or possibly from the local dialect word shucky meaning ‘shaggy’ or ‘hairy’. There have been various accounts of the animal’s appearance. Some say the  beast has only one red eye in the middle of its forehead! Its size varies from  that of a large dog..."

Go on, give it a go. Surprise! It can't be done. You simply can't convey romantic interest without the body getting into the act. To play a really successful game of flirtation your body must speak what your mouth won't say. If you're feeling good about yourself the way you focus your eyes, position your mouth, and maneuver your shoulders, hips, and hands send out signals that say, 'Check me out! I think you're hot!' After you get your target's attention you shift gears to hold onto his or her interest and move the attraction to another level. Finally, having captured and conquered the unsuspecting, or equally interested party, your body moves into a new mode of behaving that demonstrates comfort, ease, and familiarity. O..."

Most of the people I had read about who were pray-ers were also kneel-ers. For example, a second-century Christian named Hegesippus records that James, the half-brother of Jesus, “was frequently found situated upon his knees asking forgiveness for the people, so that his knees became hard after the manner of a camel, on account of always bending down upon a knee while worshipping God and asking forgiveness for the people.”[1] ..."

Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” (Genesis 8:16–17) Surely God’s words replayed in Noah’s mind as he watched his sons race to remove the final pegs that secured the door shut. Soon they would all set foot on dry ground for the first time in a year. Hearing the Creator speak directl..."

I understand the theoretical explanation, that when you dip your finger in a cup of water, the water exerts a buoyant force on your finger, and due to Newton's Third Law, your finger exerts the same amount of force on the water. So, the scale's reading increases. But intuitively, I can't understand. Then, I read some things about how pressure exerted on the bottom of the container increases with height of the water column, and since the height of the water column increases when you dip your finger, the pressure at the bottom increases. This gave me some hope that this could be the explanation, but it turns out that althoug..."

First time poster here, in need of some perspective. I live with my partner (I'll call him \"C\") and his 7yo son (\"B\"). We live in a country where children up to 12yo must wear a helmet while cycling or being a passenger on a bike. Although C is an avid and committed cyclist, he doesn't wear - and doesn't believe it is necessary to wear - a helmet, whether he’s doing a short trip, or going on a cycling holiday with his buddies. C uses a tandem on an almost daily basis with B, and occasionally a cargo bike with B in the back. C never forc..."

If the machinery of the Law could be depended on to fathom every case of suspicion, and to conduct every process of inquiry, with moderate assistance only from the lubricating influences of oil of gold, the events which fill these pages might have claimed their share of the public attention in a Court of Justice. But the Law is still, in certain inevitable cases, the pre-engaged servant of the long purse; and the story is left to be told, for the first time, in this place.

Mrs. Vesey looked the personification of human composure and female amiability. A calm enjoyment of a calm existence beamed in drowsy smiles on her plump, placid face. Some of us rush through life, and some of us saunter through life. Mrs. Vesey sat through life.
