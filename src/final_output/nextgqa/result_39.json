I just discovered the Two Set Violin channel on YouTube. I am a non-musician and I find their content very entertaining. They seem gifted but... I DON'T KNOW. I saw both Brett and Eddy \"audition\" for the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music. They were both \"rejected\" but the video is very interesting. They were each given a short music lesson by expert Curtis adjudicators. It was fascinating because though I'm not a musician what the adjudicators said made perfect sense. I was mesmerized. After the critique, I thought that Brett and Eddy needed far more practice to be true professionals, but then I watch another channel and there they are, ..."

Violinist Joseph Bologne May 4, 2023, 1:01 PM · In recent years the classical music world has started to recognize some of the composers who have been unfairly neglected by history due to their race or gender - left off the program, left out of the concert hall, left out of the history books. One such artist who is capturing the imagination not just of classical musicians, but of a wider audience is the multi-talented Afro-French violinist-composer-swordsman Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges (1745-1799), who is the subject of a new movie called Chevalier. Bologne was the non-m..."

Its power and its limitations. The first stop on my journey around the world is Mexico. The film I have chosen for this stop is El Violin. The goal of my journey is to get a glimpse into other countries, yet with the first film of my project, I see that sometimes my glimpse into another country will be very small indeed. In fact, the only thing I learned about Mexico from this film is that Ixtapaluca, Mexico, is beautiful. El Violin is not a movie about Mexico.

There are a bunch of reasons women struggle with sleeveless dresses - modesty, arm self-consciousness (I’m not saying you should be, I’m just acknowledging that people are), and temperature fluctuations (both internal and external). I can’t tell you how many messages I get from women asking for dresses with sleeves. And I do like dresses with sleeves, however, they are more limiting. Meaning they are less ver..."

Members • GlassDarkly Tiếng Việt How does \"pumping\" a swing work? Physics Ok, this seems almost trivial for \"AskScience\" - but this is simple physics question. I was on a swing set yesterday and I tried to consider the physics of exactly HOW \"pumping\" increased the speed of swinging.

They rub their beaks back and forth on a stationary object like perch or on this side of their bird cages.

The man began the scale just before 10pm last night free-climbing one of the bridge's diagonal poles. He'd removed his clothes and had been threatening to jump off. Police officers and paramedics urged the man to climb down before sending a cherry picker to the scene. Officers say the man survived the fall and is currently being treated for minor injuries at hospital. It's not known what caused the man to scale the bridge but authorities say he was on top of the pole for two hours in windy conditions.

I mean we see that Barnes kills Reed with the spikey plank..and then succumbs to her wounds and I get that it's ambiguous as to whether that was the result of her prayer or Barnes just having the last bit of strength..I mean her cut wasn't deep so she could've been faking dead for a while.. but when Paxton escapes and the butterfly lands it's ambiguous again as to whether Barnes comes back as a butterfly and lands on her finger or not..but is the alternative that there was no miracle..Barnes didn't save her an..."

Details about the film’s ending (and the revealed identity of the serial killer that haunts this horror film) are mentioned. Despite the Verdict of what seems to be a mixed review, I recommend you check out the film “Lady in White” and get back to this review. (Be advised—this is a negative but affectionate review.) OK, I’m probably not coming off as “affectionate” in this review when I say that “Lady in White” is “weird.” But I don’t really mind weirdness in horror films featuring ghosts, and so “Lady in White” should delight me. And for the most part, I was delighted. But the more I thought about it, the more I keep thinking about what doesn’t belong and what should be further developed. The result is an intriguing but uneven ghost story. What do I mean by “weird?” Well, I’m j..."

Why? Because, as this article will explain, the lean determines everything that happens from a technical standpoint during hurdle clearance. To simplify things, I’m going to categorize the lean into three basic types: minimal lean, downward lean, and forward lean. Let’s break it down: Minimal Lean is what it sounds like – clearing the hurdle without hardly leaning at all. Minimal lean is considered most efficient for women due to the low height of the hurdles. Most women can step over hurdles without deviating from their sprinting stride very much at all. This..."

It’s not been the week I’d hoped, it must be said. It’s now just over five weeks since pretty much everything fell apart, and I did my very best impression of Wile E Coyote running off a cliff edge – with sheer momentum somehow keeping me going for a while, even though there was nothing holding me up any more. It was quite the plummet. I’d like to say I’m definitely doing better than I was during the worst of it. You may remember from last week’s note that I was talking about an experiment in working half days this week. This was an experiment that, despite all the high hopes and pricey dietary supplements, spectacularly failed. The frustrations started on Monday when I got caught up in a massive password sync issue, and couldn’t get into the work accounts at all: neither hardware or software, on an..."

The X and Y chromosomes determine whether a woman will have a girl or a boy. But why do some women have all boys, while others have all girls? Is this a case of family history?

Unless you're at a party with many margaritas in your system, this \"I love you man\" moment won't be well received. But if a stranger comes up to you,asks for directions and then you find your conversation leads you down a path of similar interests, friends in common and then into a unexpected heart-to-heart discussion, then a hug at the end wouldn't seem odd. You've built a rapport and it feels natural. You may not realize it, but we are all protective of our personal space to some degree.

Dogs are also capable of having affectionate feelings for their owner. Although the way they show their love is different from ours, there are similarities.

Your dog follows you around because he wants to be with you, his leader, and it’s one way of showing his love.

To maintain this rapid metabolic rate, birds need an efficient digestive system, so let’s take a look beyond the beak.Birds forage for food soon after dawn to replace energy lost just by staying alive overnight, and in the evening to refuel after a day’s frenetic activity, but a bit like us, they are opportunistic and will feed at any time of day if food is available.They will need to convert that food into the component fats and proteins as soon as possible, not just to survive those winter nights or prepare for a long migratory flight, but for literally everything a bird does.

As a guy who's balding, I think the only way to be attractive is go through the hair surgery or hair piece route. I'd really, really, really love to CMV. I hold this view because I just feel that almost every attractive guy that's talked about is someone with a full head of hair. As someone in my early 20's this is devastating. I know there are people who will mention Patrick Stewart or whoever but those guys are just nice, rich, well-liked guys and not really attractive. Although not doing the hair surgery ..."
