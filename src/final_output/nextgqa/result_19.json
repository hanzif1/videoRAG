So impressive in fact, that research is now supporting the idea that canines have the ability to detect storms before they even arrive. How, you might be asking yourself? Well, the answer partially lies in their unique ability to detect atmospheric changes that happen prior to the onset of a storm, such as those before a hurricane. As you will soon discover, dogs have a sensory system unlike our own, making their abilities seem endless. Signs Your Dog is Detecting a HurricaneDogs, like most animals, have been observed to react in..."

Members Online • SugarCoatedParakeet Chickens stay in coop Question Hello, I'm a new chicken owner. I wanted to make sure my chickens were ok. I have 3 bantams (2 silkies and a poland). They have a custom built coop and run, which they stay in permanently due to predators in the area. Recently they have started spending the majority of their day inside the coop. They come out to eat and drink but then go straight back inside. I've been kicking them out of the coop and closing the door to force more time outside (I thought they may be broody). However they have stopped laying eggs since doing that, so I reverted to letting them have full access to the coop. They seem healthy and happy. The weath..."

Members Online • Ploymish88 Baby arms constantly up in air- is this normal? Skills and Milestones Is it normal for baby arms to always be raised in the air when they’re on their back?

Never thought anything of it until recently and saw another kid of similar age with much more relaxed arms when lying on back. She is otherwise hitting all milestones on time or ahead of schedule.

The only thing that similarly captures my baby's attention is if he sees the TV is on, he'll turn and stare at it in the same way. I know screen time is bad for babies, are these music..."

Welcome! Members Online • Feisty_Ferret_6277 Baby grabbing spoon incorrectly- what to do? 6 months old Just started 6 mo on solids. I'm having trouble getting food in her mouth. When I'm bringing the spoon towards her mouth, she grabs it with both hands right where the food is sitting. So all the food ends up on her hands, not in her mouth. Looks like she wants to feed herself. I'm happy to give her preloaded spoons, but she keeps grabbing the part of the spoon where the food sits, not the handle. Any tips on how to get her to hold the handle, or at least stop grabbing the food and let me feed her? Read more Share New to Reddit? Create your account and..."

Our pediatric pros explain how to keep baby safe as they face this learning opportunity. Why is baby stuffing food in their mouth?Stuffing food is normal. Babies rely on touch and feedback from muscles in the mouth to learn how to take manageable bites, move food around, and chew a variety of textures. This helps create what’s known as a “mental map” of the mouth.Overstuffing provides lots of deep touch and pressure feedback to baby’s brain. Babies overstuff food in the mouth because:They are learning how much food is too much.They enjoy playing and tasting the foods.They don’t realize th..."

I've been first at a few lights now and noticed I've been sitting there for a very long time, and the light wont change. I've had to let a car get in front of me, so he could trigger the light. I've tried moving closer to the white line, moving on top of the white line. I've come to the conclusion that my bike just isn't big enough to trigger the light. Is this true?

How did the drug dealer Lewis get infected with the curse before he passed it onto Skye? Is it because he witnessed the guy die who was hit by the car (when Lewis was in the house an..."

Did anyone ask a Picasso what paintbrush he used? Does anyone ask a chef what pan they sauté their darn mushrooms in? No! Whatever camera you use is just a tool.

Don’t get me wrong, different cameras suit different people, as there are difference in how big they are, how they feel in your hand, how easy they are to use, etc. You may be drawn to a particular brand or a particular type of camera but you can have the most expensive Leica and be the worst photographer.

Yesterday was my first dive into the works of Satoshi Kon, starting with the 1997 animated film: Perfect Blue. Boy was I not prepared. I've watched non-horror movies of a similar nature before (Fight Club, Inception, to name a few), but on those, by the end, I usually always have a modestly clear idea of what actually happened in reality vs what happened in the main character's head.

Members Online • allenmuff Holding Cats New to Cats/Just Adopted I’ve adopted two cats, both females when they were 3 months old and are now 9 months old.

I’ve been paying taxes for a long time. Obviously, I’ve yet to experience my own death, but I have had people close to me die. The drinking traditions that accompany the death of a loved one are interesting to me. My family, friends and I have often celebrated by drinking after a funeral or in memory of the person that died.

To some it might mean their baby slept from 7 to 7, to others it might be that parents got the best quality sleep despite getting up.

I open my eyes and the first thing I see is a teenage boy leaning over me about one foot away from my face. Confused, I try to focus on who this stranger is and that’s when I realise he’s sharpening a stick with a knife. While I’ve been sleeping off all the beers from the night before, all the wood shavings from his organic forest shank have been collecting on my chest like a tiny bonfire. Panic starts to set in. Has the only teenage serial killer in Zug found his next victim? Why am I using Tom the Cooler as a pillow? Where the fuck is my tent? Is he going to go for one swift swoop to my jugular or hit me with a flurry of jabs to the stomach and use my intestines as a washing line?

By Ashley Moor November 16, 2018 It’s a trope as old as time—or at least rom-coms: That women, when kissed passionately, will subconsciously kick their leg back.

Why didn't the US government or the agency who conducted this experiment just kill off all the Tethered after they realized that it had failed? Why keep them underground and run the risk of them escaping or someone finding out about the experiment? Keeping them alive doesn't make sense to me at all. If the word of an experiment like this were to ever get out, it would be a bombshell. Why leave a trace? Am I missing something? How did the Tethered stop mimicking their surface-counterparts?

Spoilers false Anyone remember this film? Maybe 80s or early 90s. Was about a child killer and the lady in white was her mum who killed herself after realising her kid was dead. The song in it always creeped me out. Went like \" have you ever seen a dream walking, well I did\" Just wondering if other people remember this. I loved it when I was younger.
