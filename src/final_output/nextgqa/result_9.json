It is a hot August day, bright, with patches of shade and greenish sudden light along the road. We pass through the village of Shillelagh, where my father lost our red shorthorn in a game of forty-five, and on past the mart in Carnew, where the man who won her sold her not long afterward. My father throws his hat on the passenger seat, winds down the window, and smokes. I shake the plaits out of my hair and lie flat on the back seat, looking up through the rear window. I wonder..."

In the movie, the T-Rex is sedated and shipped back to San Diego by boat. However, when the boat arrives, the entire crew has been killed. The boat rams full force into the harbor. All you see are severed limbs and blood. Then the Rex escapes and causes mayhem, But what killed the crew? I doubt the T-Rex broke free, killed them all, then went back into the cargo hold. No one investigates at all. Was is Raptors? Were a pack of Raptors set loose in San Diego and no one noticed? Seems like a massive plot hole, especially considering it was not in th..."

A bald man in a suit yells in a courtyard straight out of a di Chirico painting: shadow-murk, long colonnades, people who are more silhouettes than people. A helicopter has dropped off a parcel of cash by the bald man’s feet. A dead body lies beside it.“Hey Walker?” says the bald man: Fairfax. “Come on in with me. I’ve been looking years for someone like you.”There’s no reply from the upper storey of the colonnades. Just Walker’s face rigid as a mask receding into the dark.This is the twist.For 90 minutes, we have followed the owner of that rigid mask-like face on a revenge mission. His betraying wife and best friend are dead: the money they killed him for now lies just within his grasp. Up to now, Point Blank has been pure noir: kill the friend, win back the wife, take the money.Except that’s not what happens at all.2John Boorman’s Point Bl..."

Go on, give it a go. Surprise! It can't be done. You simply can't convey romantic interest without the body getting into the act. To play a really successful game of flirtation your body must speak what your mouth won't say. If you're feeling good about yourself the way you focus your eyes, position your mouth, and maneuver your shoulders, hips, and hands send out signals that say, 'Check me out! I think you're hot!' After you get your target's attention you shift gears to hold onto his or her interest and move the attraction to another level. Finally, having captured and conquered the unsuspecting, or equally interested party, your body moves into a new mode of behaving that demonstrates comfort, ease, and familiarity. O..."

All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.

Or a crow brings shiny objects to his new human “friend.” But can wild birds and humans actually be friends? What does that look like? What is the science behind these encounters? And how can we befriend a wild bird? Let’s get into it. Inside a Bird’s Mind and Heart First, many wonder: Do birds have the mental capacity for a relationship? Do they have feelings?

A lot of parents probably wished there was an instruction book when they suddenly find themselves with a small child in their arms. A baby has many needs but cannot express them with words.

When my Slovakian friend, Stanka, visited me in Chennai, I took her to all the places that make Chennai, well, Chennai.

My 2.5yo is perfectly capable of picking up food and feeding himself, but he won’t. He will pick up a few pieces of his favorite things then he waits for me to feed him the rest. If I walk away and try to give him time to eat on his own he will literally just sit there and play around. He literally seems like he cou..."

It is not unusual for curvature to develop unexpectedly, either suddenly or over a period of time. In this case it’s possible that a condition kno..."

I've seen conflicting advice and wonder if you can help. When stopping behind stationary traffic, where should you position yourself in the lane? Should you be immediately behind the car in front, or off to one side? (Both with first gear selected, clutch in, brakes on, checking mirrors, with clear exit route in case of car behind not stopping) Thanks! Read more Share New to Reddit?

This is known as the ‘Command Position’ or ‘Dominant  Position’. The advantages of this position are: You get a good view of the road ahead. Other vehicles get a good view of you. You are dominating your lane, stopping following traffic overtaking until it is safe. You will be in the view of the wing and the internal mirrors of the vehicle in front of you.
