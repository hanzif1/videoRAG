He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here. He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun, and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last. He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it ac..."

It was, as Bill afterward expressed it, \"during a moment of temporary mental apparition\"; but we didn't find that out till later. There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course. It contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a Maypole. Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with. We talked it over on the front steps of the hotel.

Christina in a Red Cloak, 1913, Mervyn O’Gorman © Royal Photographic Society Collection: A dramatic and comparatively unusual close-up portrait, taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset in 1913. The large aperture setting has reduced the background to near abstraction, and the lack of any obvious period references gives this image a remarkably modern feel. The girl in question is Christina, and the images—on show in our Drawn by Light exhibition until 21 June 2015—have been doing the rounds on social media and in the world’s press. The D..."

Published on Aug 9, 2016Sep 16, 2024 by Hugh W. Roberts This is no joke. Sorry if you thought I was going to double you up with laughter. No, today I’m talking stereotyping! I thought it was a thing of the past, but it seems it’s as evident today as it has always been. Take, for example, television. Have you ever noticed that during a pub scene on a TV show, the men seem to be constantly drinking pints or bottles of beer while women drink glasses of wine or a gin/vodka tonic?

At the same time, I still maintain old friendships, and the night before Abundance started I got an invitation to attend the launch of the DC Bureau of GB News, after which I was amused to find my presence noted in a gossip column.

Toby Buckle 21 Jan 2025 — 18 min read Among the many evils the 2024 election released into the world was a renewed round of discussions of the woes of young men, and how we’re being failed by liberalism, or feminism, or the Democratic Party. This narrative has been around for some time, but has been slowly gathering momentum. It runs something like:Young men in America are lonely, struggling to find community and romantic partners. Many are permanently single. Whereas modern society affirms women, boys are looked down on, scolded, treated like dangerous predators post MeToo, their concerns arrogantly dismissed by feminists, a culturally dominant liberalism, and the Democratic Party alike.

The microphone choice and placement that gives you the perfect guitar sound might completely foul up the vocal sound, and vice versa. Plus, you would think recording an acoustic guitar would be easy.
