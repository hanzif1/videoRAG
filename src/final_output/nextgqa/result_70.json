Lost Media/Film I'm really enjoying the mystery media posts from u/Crow1880 so I decided to make a thread specifically on the subject of commercials.

It was the summer of 1999; I was 7 years old and in need of a friend.

Just look at any open mic night and you’ll see beginners making the same mistakes: Standing too far from the mic… Holding the mic incorrectly… Moving around inconsistently..."

After worldcon, I drove home with Janice Gelb and Stephen Boucher, through Washington, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, the Land o’ Enchantment, Sante Fe… and then down to Albuquerque for Bubonicon, our local con.   Much much smaller than worldcon. of course, less than a thousand people… but very low key, a reminder of what fandom used to be like.

My destination was Floors Castle and a meet and greet with the Duke of Roxburgh. What, ho. With the Tweed River ahead of me, and a Land Rover Experience instructor waving madly at me, I did as I was bid, and dipped the snout of the Land Rover Discovery 4 into the river.Keeping the Disco’s nose pointed at the instructor standing downstream on the opposite bank, I made it across the bonnet-high river just in time for tea and scones.

However, when we go on her walks during the day she becomes an absolute nightmare. No matter how many times I tell her to stop pulling, she just continues. It’s like she walking me. During the whole 30 minute walk all she does is pull and scavenges for poop to eat. Not dog poop though, I believe it’s poop from whatever other animals roam our neighborhood. I know certain animals carry parasites and can be very bad for her to eat. HOW DO I STOP HER FROM PULLING AND EATING RANDOM ANIMALS POOP?..."

Most of the people I had read about who were pray-ers were also kneel-ers. For example, a second-century Christian named Hegesippus records that James, the half-brother of Jesus, “was frequently found situated upon his knees asking forgiveness for the people, so that his knees became hard after the manner of a camel, on account of always bending down upon a knee while worshipping God and asking forgiveness for the people.”[1] ..."

Question I remember watching a movie or a TV show with a scene where a woman who has a newborn baby who won't stop crying and she suffocates the baby then places the baby next to her sleeping husband. Her husband gets arrested for killing the baby for \"rolling over\" onto it but she is later arrested because they figured out she killed the baby earlier. Anyone know where this is from?

It is important to teach children how these devices work before going into the water.Helping them understand the importance of this essential piece of safety equipment and how it can help them stay afloat can prevent children from neglecting to wear life jackets. Without a life jacket, your child could be at a greater risk of drowning if they fall into the water.However, the life jacket you wear (as an adult) is probably not the best fit for your child.

However, year after year, hundreds of people tragically lose their lives on the water while not wearing a lifejacket.Why is that? Well, there's definitely a stigma associated with wearing lifejackets, especially among teens and adults who feel like they're for children or people who can't swim. In fact, it's pretty commonplace to see boaters out on the water, even jet skiing, without their lifejackets.

No matter which direction you’re going (up or down) your body will dictate how you fall. I’ve fallen down the stairs on my knees because I was leaning forward. I’ve also fallen on my ass because I was standing more upright. When I fall UP the stairs I always fall forward. My weight and body is angled that way.

The pain can also increase gradually, getting worse as the days go by. It’s a common injury, but there’s little comfort in that fact—especially if it stops you from doing the things you enjoy. We call it a “pulled” muscle, but really it’s a strain—a muscle or tendon injury that happens when the tissue is torn or overstretched.1 Not to be confused with a sprain, which happens when a ligament (a band of tissue that attaches bones, muscles, and organs) is torn or overstretched.2 The pain from a pulled muscle in the back ranges from minor annoyance to intense pain, and it can take several weeks or, in some cases, a few months to heal.3 Back pain, often due to a pulle..."

What I like most about him at this point is that while we’re getting intimate he likes to kiss me on the forehead. For some reason, it makes me feel like my body is ascending to some higher spirit realm of human connection. Like I actually go crazy for it. Oxytocin floodgates overflowing. Maybe it’s because I haven’t been treated like this in years, but I can only compare this feeling to what I think it’s like when the Na’vi have that spiri..."

For example, when one person hugs another, most observers silently assume that the back patting that occurs towards the end of the hug is a gesture of affection and that the air kisses made - the sound made on the side of someone's cheek - is also affection. The reality is that the pat is used in the same way professional wrestlers use it - to tell the other person to end the hug and break the clinch. If you are really not too keen about hugging someone but are forced into it because the people ahead of you did it, you're likely to begin the back patting in the air even before the hug begins.

Look at her, standing there at the back of the church without a prayer book, or in the abandoned graveyard. Or, rather – don’t look at her. You never know what you might unleash. Keep your head down, keep walking, and carry on as if you never saw her in the first place.

The film narrates the story of a black woman who suffered from patriarchal violence and domination of her father in the beginning of the twentieth century in rural Georgia. The woman’s struggle is situated within a bigger hegemony which is the enslavement and domination of the white society over the black society in America. The film was criticized for being too stereotypical of black society in America. The stereotypical images in the film varied from presenting the black males as sexually abusive and violent beasts to the black women who were presented as mamm..."
