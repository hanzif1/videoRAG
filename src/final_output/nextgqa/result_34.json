Three Lists that Will Improve Your Relationship with Your Dog megan Deciphering Dogs July 13, 2017 February 3, 2020 My favorite dog behavior is the shake-off. Now suddenly I’m pondering how much of a dog nerd you have to be to have a “favorite dog behavior”. I love the shake-off because it has such a connotation of moving on, which is exactly what dogs are saying when they shake-off. Other than a wet dog shaking the water off its body, most shake-offs appear to have some aspect of trying to improve the mental state.

Just recently Dog Walkers Melbourne reported on studies showing how dogs drink water. The latest research into the dogs method of shaking water from their coats shows that as they have evolved to do so with the highest efficiency possible.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy. Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car).

I started in 1991 with a quick snapshot, and I continued taking photographs with each departure. I never set out to make this series. I just took these photographs as a way to deal with the sadness of leaving. It gradually turned into our good-bye ritual. And it seemed natural to keep the camera busy, because I had been taking pictures every day while I was there.

Spinning, rolling, and swinging! Oh my! Posted: October 17, 2017 Children need the dizzying input that comes from spinning, rolling, and swinging. These important movement experiences help the child’s nervous system to mature and organize. Many adults eventually start to dislike the feeling of spinning or repetitive swinging, but for children, it is a crucial sensory and motor skill input. Children need to spin, roll, and swing indoors and outdoors. One preschool team wondered how the tone of their room would change if they created an indoor gross motor area. They were worried that it would be loud and distracting, but they found just the opposite. When children were allowed to use their big muscles and move in active ways, their minds and their emotions settled more easily to focus on other play later in the schedule. Thi..."

Members Online • well-thats-cool- Tiếng Việt How to prevent baby from spinning in the crib? So my almost 10 week old baby has managed to spin himself sideways in his crib a few times over the last few weeks. I had been trying to put off swaddle transitioning until last night when he somehow spun himself the complete opposite way I laid him down, his feet were where his head was and vice versa. Then all night he kept turning so his feet were to the headboard of his crib and he would kick the ever loving Jesus out of it.

I left the system switched on overnight, with the cat in the room, and this morning everything has vanished from the right hand monitor. There were a whole bunch of terminals open with a whole bunch of random cat-written garbage, clearly it’s been walking on the keyboard all night.

This film blew me away. I did not know what I was expecting but I was more than impressed. I actually had to see it two days in a row, the second one being with a Q+A with Sebastian, Adam and the director Aaron Shimberg. I had a question that didn’t get picked, but wanted to know what your thoughts were. At the very end, when Oswald calls Guy, “Edward” was that meaning that they always knew Guy was/is Edward?

To play a really successful game of flirtation your body must speak what your mouth won't say. If you're feeling good about yourself the way you focus your eyes, position your mouth, and maneuver your shoulders, hips, and hands send out signals that say, 'Check me out! I think you're hot!' After you get your target's attention you shift gears to hold onto his or her interest and move the attraction to another level.

He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination. \"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\" \"Not at all.

It lands right next to a monk directly behind the armorer at the Temple. It's there every time I go to the temple. I thought maybe it was indicating something was on top of the pagoda structure but I haven't found any way to climb it? The monk never has anything to say so my thought that the bird was leading me to a side quest was also incorrect. Not quite sure what I'm missing with this one. Read more Share New to Reddit?

And they did show some interest! They flew back and forth to the wooden box, landed on the roof, and peered in though the round hole. I was thrilled. But two days passed, and they didn't seem to be actually building inside. It was March. Time for them to begin nesting. They had to choose a nest site soon. I tried to tell myself I would be OK with it if the bluebirds found a nesting cavity in the woods. They'd still be close by. But I couldn't help it — I longed to watch them nest right there. I wanted to look out the living room window and see the birds with heaven on their backs. To sweeten the deal... Then I heard about mealworms — a particular kind of moth larvae that could persuade the bluebirds to stay. Me..."

She’s bold, bright, a leader – no wallflower this girl. She’s eager to connect with her peers, and a simple hello isn’t enough. She wants their attention. She wants interaction. And, ideally, she wants a reaction.  Naturally, her social skills are a work in progress, and while she’s learning how to engage in play, she’s often misunderstood. Her antics sometimes worry and embarrass her parents and elicit their disapproval. Her toddler peers are all-forgiving (even when they’ve been on the losing end of her toy snatching), but her friends’ parents might be less understanding. In every RIE parent/toddler group I’ve facilitated there is at least one boy or girl who experiments wit..."

They either go to one extreme and yell, threaten, restrain, or even spank the child, or they go to the other extreme and give in. In both cases, the parent may stop the meltdown, but they haven’t taught their child to behave more appropriately. And the next time their child is uncomfortable, he or she will simply throw another tantrum. In my experience, parents are very resistant to the idea of their kids being unhappy or uncomfortable. They learn what their child has taught them: if you make me uncomfortable, I’m going to make you uncomfortable. When a child ..."

NYC Transit buses travel at an average speed of 7.5 mph. On bus routes such as the M96, M23, M15, Q32, BX35 and B63, the average speed is 6 mph or less. That buses are traveling in slow motion is obvious to everyone, especially riders, who rank it the most serious problem with bus service. Slow bus service discourages people from taking buses, especially for work trips where travel time is critical. Slow bus service contributes to very long travel times to work in New York City, as shown by the latest census. Bus service is slow for many reasons. Traffic congestion is clearly a major factor. But other problems are just as important: Buses spend as much as 30% of their time waiting for passengers to board and exit. Increased crowding on buses due to ridership growth has lengthened delays fr..."

Maybe they circle a few times around the bed before lying in it, or maybe they dig around the blankets a bit. Even stranger, does your dog “make” their bed before getting in it? Some dogs appear to be unhappy with the way their bed looks or feels, and end up piling their blankets into a nest or pile. Some dogs may even move their bed to a different place in the houseWhat is it about their beds that makes them so unsatisfied? Why do they move their beds?The Root of the BehaviorLong before dogs had beds, wild canines performed similar pre-bed routines as domesticated dogs. Circling, for example, is used not only for comfort but also for safety and territory. Circling around an area allows the ..."

Sunday morning, March 10, dawned overcast. It was, looking back, the beginning of probably the single best day in and around a National Park I’ve had so far. I slipped out of the eco-tent to have a look at the sea off of Drunk Bay from one of Concordia’s common areas.

He had put it plainly the night before: “If I don’t see a sea turtle and a ray, I’m going to be really disappointed.” We decided to have a quick breakfast while the others were still stirring and head down to Salt Pond Bay for a quick look for sea turtles.

Today I show you how! Playing guitar is split down the middle between two main jobs: Lead Guitar and Rhythm Guitar. Lead guitar plays a lot of single note melodies and Rhythm guitar well… plays chords. And that is how we usually think about it. So that is the focus when starting to learn rhythm guitar: the chords. We memorize shapes, stretch our fingers, and work on building hand strength to be able to play these chords. It takes a while. At first they don’t sound like much of anything. You make the shape of the chord, strum it, and then start to figure out why it doesn’t sound the way you have heard it before. Then the refining starts. Making small adjustments to the way your fingers are placed starts to give you the results..."

Contents Something about sound The strings The body The air inside More detail and other links First, something about sound If you put your finger gently on a loudspeaker you will feel it vibrate - if it is playing a low note loudly you can see it moving. When it moves forwards, it compresses the air next to it, which raises its pressure. Some of this air flows outwards, compressing the next layer of air. The disturbance in the air spreads out as a travelling sound wave. Ultimately this sound wave causes a very tiny vibration in your eardrum - but that's another story. At any point in the air near the source of sound, the molecules are moving backwards and forwards, and the air pressure varies up and down by very small amounts. The number of vibrations per second is called the frequency which is measured in cycles per second or Hertz (Hz). The pitch of a note is almost entirely determined by the frequency: high frequency ..."

Stephen King. 80+ books. 200+ short stories. Thousands of nightmares. And the man still writes every. single. day. So, as a full-time author with a full-time life…I tried his routine for 14 days. Here’s what happened. And more importantly, here’s what you need to know.A Book in Three MonthsSome authors take years to write one book. Others, like King, can write a book in 3 months. He’s been titled a prolific author, and he’s not the only one. I’ve published 2 to 3 books a year for the last ten years. I’m curious to see our similarities. So how do people write so fast? Most writers are told it should take longer to write a book. That “real novels” take years. That “slow and steady” is the only way. But let’s be honest—how many writers are dragging ..."

Paul Jennings and the Goosebumps books were basically a gateway drug towards the likes of Stephen King.Fast forward to now — no matter how many of Stephen King’s books I read, I can never quite put my finger on the magic behind them. Ever so subtly, King has the ability to freak me out. It doesn’t always happen instantly — his scenes and stories settle upon me over the minutes, hours, days that follow until I find myself unable to stop thinking about them. He really has mastered his craft.His story-telling ability aside, one of the most impressive things about King his is ability to produce such huge volumes of work in short period..."

By Chris Korfist28 Comments FacebookTweetLinkedInEmail [mashshare] English | Español By Chris Korfist My affair with the squat started a long time ago, back in 1982. I was going into 7th grade, and I was attending the University of Illinois Football camp in Champaign, Illinois. The football camps were very different than they are today. It was a camp for kids to have fun and the coaches make some easy money. Introduce the campers to some fundamentals, let them play on the Astroturf, go into the locker room, get a T-shirt, play some 7 on 7 and finish with some awards and a waterme..."

Unraveling Low Squat Ankle Hops When I was a young lad interested in improving my athletic performance, there were limited places to find training information.  There was no YouTube in which to type “vertical jump exercises”, or Google to query “best vertical jump workout”. No no I had only a few weapons at my disposal to find ways to improve my speed and jumping power. One was the 1980’s weightlifting manual that came with the concrete weight set my dad had bought from K-Mart.  The exercises that seemed to feel good, I did, and the ones that felt awkward, I ditched.  Funny enough, barbell squatting did not make my early list, while the more interesting deadlift variations seemed to be more useful.
