Menopause means ‘the last menstrual period’. It’s not only those who identify as women who will experience menopause. Some transgender men, non-binary people and intersex people or people with variations in sex characteristics may also experience menopause. Menopause is a natural event and transition that women experience, however, the timing and symptoms are different for everyone. You can look at your family history to get an idea of when you might go through it. It’s likely to be a similar age to when your mother or older sisters started theirs. Menopause can als..."

The dog in question was a large, strong breed, and there was much concern because of his past history. As I watched, it became obvious that the other dog being used in the test was very worried.

When babies are on their moms chest, and there is pressure/ resistance on their arms they push up (counter the resistance). This facilitates feeding at the breast as it helps them lift their head and smell the breast (movement also shown to be facilitated by odour and the smell of moms milk), and they can move to the breast. Your baby’s arms waving around are helping them learn. ❤️. If you are frustrated by “arms getting in the way” of latching, move the..."

The lure of the selfie is the enticing idea that we might be seen by the rest of the world in the same way that we see ourselves. At the right angle, in the right light, with the right expression. Not weirdly lit, from an awkward angle and snorting at a joke like the photos other people take of us. No, a selfie is a carefully composed photo, in all the best ways. Selfies have the power to make us feel great, or – on the days where we can’t find our angle – make us feel rotten.

Topics Chemical ReactionsLight Activity Type Discrepant Event (Demonstration only) Language English Print Students may have witnessed the effects of a chemical reaction when chemicals are mixed: heat is released or absorbed, bubbles form or fizzing occurs, a noise produced, or the colour changes. During this demo, however, no new chemicals are added to the flask. All you do is shake the liquid in the flask and the colour changes! Although it doesn't look like you have added any chemicals to cause the reaction, shaking up the bottle does mix the liquid with another substance: Oxygen (air). The mysterious liquid in the flask contains a chemical — a dye called methylene blue. The methylene blue is reduced (loses oxygen) by the potassium hydroxide and glucose solution and as a result loses its colour. When you shake the bottle, the oxygen in the air mixes with the solution and re-oxidizes the methylene ..."

They help to keep your bladder, uterus, vagina and bowel (pelvic organs) in the right place. Your pelvic floor muscles should be kept strong and active, just like any other muscle. All bladder and bowel functions need good pelvic floor muscles. For example, when you need to go to the toilet, you use your pelvic floor muscles to prevent any leaks. Then, you will fully relax them to pass urine when you physically get to the toilet. Strong pelvic floor muscles boost your core strength and stability. They can improve your sexual function too.

Menu About Blog Contact Transparency Policy Menu Unpacking Review: Sublimely Simple Storytelling Posted on January 16, 2024December 26, 2024 by Chloe R Welcome to my Unpacking review. We were not given a review code for this title. Unpacking is a wonderfully hand-drawn puzzle game released by Witch Beam, an indie game development studio, on November 2nd, 2021. While included in the “puzzle” category, this is in my top 5 most favorite cozy games of all times: no timers, no errors, no tricks. Unpacking is one of the most relaxing and emotionally charged games I’ve played in a long time. Starting is easy, with easy settings are really nice accessibility options, which I immediately toggled. There’s no difficulty to select, making it into the same, lovely experience for everyone involved. Unpacking on Steam Unpacking on Nintendo Switch Unpacking on PlayStation Unpacking o..."

I do it several times a year. Sometimes it’s a full-scale project; like the desecration of Euston Station, I mercilessly tear down the old, and replace it with the new. Beauty gives way to cold practicality. Other times I tinker at the edges, neatening up a shelf of books here, creating space to fit a brand-new hardback there. Once I organised my books by colour until they formed an infinite prismatic loop. I could only tolerate it for a few weeks and quickly rearranged everything back, but I didn’t at all regret it because the whole process was fun for me. Sitting down on my carpet sorting my books by size and theme (alphabetising them is mad unless one is an actual librarian) was oddly mediative. I dipped in and out of forgotten novels and abandoned comics that had languished at th..."

It started with the itch.io pack for Ukraine, which allowed me to support a good cause and get a ton of indie games I had been hoping to try out in one fell swoop. And then I found a stream VOD of one of my favorite YouTubers playing the oft-Tiktok-recommended game Unpacking and I, high off the joy of submitting the huge final project that marked the end of my grad program, decided to finally check it out. And let me say, I’ve barely had Unpacking for a week, but it may already be one of my favorite gaming experiences in a long while. The concept of Unpacking is pretty simple. You… unpack. In each level of the game, you’re presented with a new room or collection of rooms filled with sealed cardboard boxes and your goal is to unpack ea..."

I am finding this recent, sustained immersion in Matthew’s narrative very interesting. We have often noted how Matthew’s accounts are more compressed than the other gospels, particularly Mark, and that he compensates for that by including additional episodes. But the compression itself actually gives the narratives an intensity and power that I had not expected.In the previous episode, Jesus has been seeking solitude (with his closest followers) after hearing the news..."

In northern Vietnam, karst mountains surrounding Ninh Binh obscure the misty, meandering waterways that cut through looming limestone outcrops. These rivers, nestled into the rice fields, are frequented by small, rustic wooden vessels, steered using only the feet of the rowers. This remarkable tradition of using feet on the oars to propel and steer is legendary and, deservedly, quite the tourist attraction.A trip to Ninh ..."

Here's how to strike the right guitar pose! 10 Mar 2025 • 5 min read We’ve all seen them. Eccentric guitarists who hang their guitar all the way down to their thighs and strum their strings in a low bow.

Community Hub 🗨 Just Chatting direvus August 9, 2022, 12:44pm 1 So when Justin’s lessons suggested doing a couple of minutes standing up practice in the routine, I dutifully did it for a while, but I didn’t find it very challenging, didn’t see much point to it, so I dropped it when I went into Grade 2 consolidation mode. Tonight on a whim I played through a bunch of songs standing up and to my surprise, some stuff actually felt way easier to me. In particular, being able to fret the strings without strangling the guitar neck, barre chords were easier to hold down, vibrato more comfortable. Maybe it’s just because my posture when sitting is dreadful, but when I’m standing I can feel the guitar body is positively locked in place between my right arm and my torso/hip, so the head end of the neck is kind of jus..."

This lesson is for both electric and acoustic guitars - the main difference is the size of the body (acoustic guitars tend to be bulkier), but the holding position remains the same for both types. If there's one piece of advice I could give you, to remember every single time you pick up the guitar... don't hunch! So many guitarists get into the habit of hunching over their guitar. Annoys the hell out of me. Hunching will inevitably affect your posture and can lead to back problems later in life. Let's look at how to hold a guitar whilst sitting down...
