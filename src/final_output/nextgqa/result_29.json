Members Online • Technical_Piglet_438 Tiếng Việt How probable is to squish the baby by bending over? Question Ok, this probably is kinda irrational but I can't be the only one with a terrible fear of accidentally squishing baby by let's say, bending over. For example I was taking a shower and couldn't reaxh my feet so I put my foot on a small stool and bended forward a bit, I instantly felt somw presure in my belly, like a balloon that is being... Well... Squished. So this random thought crossed my mind, did I accudentally squished/harmed the baby? Now I'm 17w and I don't know how to put my shoes on, wash my feet, cut my toenails, put my panties on, etc without bending. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be post..."

Two nights ago I noticed that my 5 year old son was doing a bunch of involuntary hand movements while reading at bedtime. He was sort of high fiving the air and would also move his hands up (as if gesturing “I don’t know” except that wasn’t what he was trying to communicate). I had noticed that second gesture once or twice in days leading up to this specific incident but it would happen in a flash and he acted “normal” again. Ever..."

My left hand gets stiff while I’m playing guitar. LOL Ok, I’ll go into detail. When I move my finger while playing, my left hand suddenly hardens during the performance, so it doesn’t move. It feels like “Freeze” I feel like I’m getting more and more power while playing, and then I’m getting too much power and stopping. It usually happens when I keeps moving my fingers. If I don’t give force into fingers, the speed doesn’t come out. However, if I put enough force, I will soon become more and more tense and harden. If I try to move my fingers in a hardened state, my left hand literally malfunctions. I don’t think it’s my left hand, Alien’s Left Hand lol Has anyone experienced a similar case? If so, how did you solve it? How can I properly distribute the power? jptk May 14, 2022, 11:28am #2 I’m not sure I’ve experienced e..."

As an action flick, it's pretty solid. Nothing award winning, but definitely engaging. There were a few memorable scenes for sure. However, the final scene where Ottway enters the wolves' den literally sums up the fears he instilled in the men throughout the movie (getting too close to the den). Not only has he lost all his companions at this point, he had essentially lost all hope for survival. This is almost key to how his character was set up in the beginning of the film (lit..."

While she appreciates her son’s enthusiasm, she struggles to reign him in and finds herself yelling, “You’re not listening!” She says they often take nature walks with friends and he inevitably runs ahead at an unsafe distance.

This blog was updated on 21 December 2023. I often get asked questions about boundaries and they tend to be some of the hardest to answer. A boundary feature can be a fence, wall, hedge, ditch, piece of wire, or sometimes even just the edge of a driveway. They can be the cause of heated debate and trigger arguments between neighbours, sometimes over just a few inches of ground.

He soon became hooked but this was kept a secret from me for 4 years. He would use when me and my children were asleep in bed. All unknown to us.

He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination. \"You are engaged,\" said I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\" \"Not at all.

Give me a haunted house, a graveyard and a black-clad figure loitering in the middle-distance, and I am jelly. The 1989 TV film of The Woman in Black made me scared to go to bed. The theatre version gave me goose-pimples. In fact, here is the first part of a two-part list of some of the films that freaked me out.

A herd of animals—scabby dogs of mixed breeds—rush through the rocky terrain, galloping like wild horses through the desert. Within seconds, the vehicle crashes. Confused, passengers emerge and assess the damage in the wilderness. One of them tries to make sense of the mystery: “Where did all t..."
