Something I've noticed of late - if I'm stopped at a red light in my car on a 1-lane road without bike lanes, any and all bicyclists will lane split their way past me, then get in front of me (or the first car in line). Then, when the light turns green, they will casually pedal as though they are out for a Sunday stroll and keep people from being able to accelerate as quickly. Often times, this causes people to miss green lights. Snark aside, is there a logical explanation for this practice that I can tell myself when I would otherwise be fuming?

These are the folks that are stuck on using rules. Those that weren’t using these shortcuts were able to learn much faster.

I need help Pythons Ball Pythons mites, health worldwide_pythons January 4, 2021, 4:00am 1 Hey guys, I recently picked up two new pythons, a 5 level/tub enclosure, and a herpstat for an absolute steal. But I may see why now. One of my snakes definitely has mites, I’m not sure how bad of a degree it is but he has them either way. I do not believe the other snake has mites but I want to treat her as if she does just to play it safe. Both snakes are under 200 grams at the moment. I have heard that leaving the snake to soak in a dawn dish soap and water bath can help, if so how long and and how often should I soak each snake? I have both on paper towels right now as a result of seeing the mites. Any and all advice helps immensely as this is my first time dealing with snake mites.

And in the post-credit scene, we see that he had his bone claws grew back. However in Days Of Future Past (2014), Wolverine has his Adamanitum claws back. What happened between the two movies? Edit: guys, Sorry I didn't make it clear. I am talking about the original timeline in DOFP, not after Wolverine changed the history. Wolverine's claws can be seen when Pryde was tran..."

Did Skye really kill her mom? If so, was the mom who was shown in the crowd during the final concert scene also imaginary?

A place for photos, art, and discussion of owls Members • [deleted] Can owls experience grief/ loss? So I work with owls (a quick overview of my account confirms this) and in one of our aviaries was an Eagle owl, a barn owl and a tawny (barred for you Americans) owl.

Could this coincide with the death of the other owl or is it due to something else?

Members • [deleted] Putting a blanket over your head to protect yourself from a bad guy is silly, yet it makes you feel safe. In the wild, covering yourself would make you harder for predators to see. Maybe we've inherited this silly sense of safety from our ancestors, who needed the cover more than we do. Archived post.

Industrial designers, tinkers, and mayhem builders. Follow our travels. More About Haus Page » Most guys understand the inability to cool down at the end of a long work day during the summer. Most guys also like the feel of a decently heavy blanket over them to help them sleep. However, you can't be cool and have a heavy blanket unless it's friggin' freezing in the rest of the room. You basically feel akin to Mr. Freeze. No Longer! Last week our AC was out, so my wife devised a way to make a quilt-like blanket that holds ICE PACKS! It's the ultimate heavy blanket, but keeps you cold at the same time. The other benefit is that during winter, she could heat the packs and create a warm blanket too. Overall, we both win during opposing seasons. Things you'll need..."

CHI Talks I have lived in the city for a few years and I feel like in the past 1-2 years there has been a noticeable increase in the number of people riding their bikes and more recently electric scooters on the sidewalks. This year in particular I've felt like there are far more instances too of bikers/scooters traveling extremely fast past people, and I've heard some people yell at them to get on the street. I'm thinking of sending an email to the mayor (and cc'ing the chief of police) about it. edit: To be clear since some thought I was serious, the last sentence about sending an email was sarcasm.

Read the latest news from Jordan. Old notebooks I started keeping a journal my freshman year in college, and kept the habit for years afterward. I'm still not sure whether it was a good habit or a bad one. A few months ago, when I sat down to write an afterword for the Prince of Persia graphic novel, I pulled out those old notebooks and started to browse through them, figuring it might help me wrap my mind around Prince of Persia's 20-year history. It's all there. The story of how Prince of Persia came to be, and almost didn't. It occurred to me that as a case history, a time-capsule view of the videogame industry as it was in the 1980s, this was a story others might find interesting too.
