Before two heartsick peasants begged me to find their missing daughters.

For my production, I  chose that pink would be Elle’s color . . .as in, it was very selectively used throughout the show.  Brooke has a pink shirt in her exercise video (she is a Delta Nu after all, and connects with Elle).  The three main DN’s have pink dresses for ‘Legally Blonde Remix’, and Emmett changes to a pink sh..."

                "detail": "When do babies start laughing and why it matters? Most babies start laughing around 3 to 4 months old, though some may do it a little earlier or later. Why it matters: • Sign of social development – Laughing shows your baby is starting to engage and connect with people. • Brain growth – Laughter means your baby is recognizing faces, voices, and situations, which signals healthy cognitive development. • Emotional bonding – Your laughter and their laughter create a feedback loop of joy and attachment. • Motor skills – Laughing uses facial muscles and breathing patterns that help with future speech. It’s a key milestone because it shows healthy brain growth, social connection, and emotional bonding — plus, it’s one of the sweetest ways your baby says they feel safe and happy with you. #Babydevelopment #Parentingtips #viralpost2025 #reelsvideoシ #followerseveryone #Hilighteveryone #reels2025 #reelsvideo #reelschallenge #foryoupage #fyp #followers #baby #babyreels #newborn #development #mile..."

He remembers nothing about his past life and has no idea how to escape. Manuel soon discovers he has internet access, and it doesn’t take him long to figure out the truth, or at least what the people who put him here want him to believe is the truth. After being told one lie after another, Manuel eventually comes close to learning who he really is, and what he must do to escape both the white room and those trying to use him.I got sent this book from Chicken House a little while ago, and as I was looking for an interesting and quick read I thought I’d pick it up! The book follows Manuel, a boy who wakes up in a white room with his memories wiped. Manuel soon discovers that he is actually trapped in a si..."

Max CeaFeb 10, 202562ShareSubscribeUniversal Language, which hits select theaters Feb 12, has been twelve years in the making. It was directed by the Canadian filmmaker, Matthew Rankin, but Rankin describes it as the work of a group brain — a collaboration between him and the writers Ila Firouzabadi and Pirouz Nemati (who also stars). That the film took a long time and was a group effort makes sense when you watch it. Universal Language weaves together three stories that take place in a fictional zone somewhere between Winnipeg and Tehran, and it is packed with witty details, lived experience, clever cinematic references, a communal spirit, and lofty ideas about humanity’s relationship to places and one another.

RICHARD MANUEL'S jumping-off point for out yonder turned out to be a motel room in a sleepy Florida town called Winter Park, a suburb of Orlando. That night--it was March 3, 1986--a truncated version of The Band had played the Cheek to Cheek Lounge, a humbling comedown from the heated days when they toured with Bob Dylan and played festivals like the Isle of Wight. Early the next morning, after a night of booze and drugs, he got out of the bed where he lay with his wife, went into the bathroom and hanged himself. He was a month short of forty-three, a man victimized by the promises and betrayals of rock and roll. Ten years later, his friends and family still aren't sure why he did it, if they can accept that he did it at all. Growing up ..."

I wish we were right now sitting around a circle together, eating snacks and prepping for Show & Tell. In one of my earliest newsletters I told the story of a four year old boy who brought his umbilical cord to Show & Tell. What would you bring, right now? I’d love to hear. Thank you so much for being here, everyone. I adore you. Love, Andrea 🖤△ A limited number of signed copies of ‘You Better Be Lightning' and ‘Lord of the Butterflies’ are now ..."

On Sunday 5 July 2020 there was a Poetry of the Lockdown event as part of Ledbury Poetry Festival Online.  The event featured a fascinating selection of Lockdown inspired poems, including poets commissioned by LPF, Naomi Shihab Nye, Sarala Estruch, Suzannah Evans, Elaine Beckett and Kim Moore. They read alongside poets who submitted to Ledbury Poetry Festival’s online call out. Hosted by Chloe Garner. These poems were written during Lockdown and the Coronavirus pandemic, at a time when it seemed the whole country, and in fact the whole world was going through the same crisis.

She is clearly writing down what he says in her notebook. I would assume he's giving her the map we see a few minutes later. Who do we think this older man is?

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.

Their home in a quiet suburb of Olympia, Washington, is filled with souvenirs and trinkets from their travels. There’s a plastic lizard in the master bathroom with the words “Cayman Islands” painted on it. From Curaçao there’s a framed patchwork collage made of oilcloth hanging in the entrance hall. On the gray summer day when I visit them, we all sit comfortably in their living room, Green decked out in a bright shirt with “Bermuda Islands” emblazoned on it, from a cruise in 2013.

When determining how to introduce cats to dogs, remember that each animal is unique. For instance, just because your cat got along with your previous dogs, that doesn't mean the cat will like all dogs. So always use caution and proceed slowly when introducing your cat to a new dog (or your dog to a new cat).If you have multiple cats or dogs, it’s best to introduce them only one at a time. Have at least two people present — one to handle the dog’s leash and the other to tend to the cat.  In the initia..."

They hold on to something that simply isn’t there, adding stress and anxiety because of the unnecessary need to manage/maintain it. This is especially true in relationships where a person would hold on to someone despite them no longer being a part of their life.Letting go of old attachments might sound easy — all you need is a refresh.But the truth is, it isn’t that simple.A bond like a romantic relationship has become a part of your identity.
