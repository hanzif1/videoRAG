A Scary Walk and Wet Feet June 16, 2022 Mary Loudermilk 4 Mins Read Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email WhatsApp Then Peter called to him, “Lord, if it’s really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water. ”So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. (Matthew 14:28-29, NKJV) Outspoken, impetuous Peter. He had numerous faults, but he was also committed to the Lord and quick to repent when he failed. He seemed to be the unofficial leader of the twelve. Because of his impulsive nature, it isn’t surprising that Peter was the one who asked the Lord if he could walk on the water to meet Him. It had already been a long day when the disciples got into the boat to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Jesus had ministered to the multitudes and then fed them by..."

And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.” --Matthew XIV 28-31 Few reflections will be sure to cross the mind of any thoughtful reader of this narrative. I. THE MIXED CHARACTER OF THE BELIEVER’S EXPERIENCE is very palpably suggested to us. Peter was undoubtedly a bold believer in Jesus Christ.

Anyway, you know the routine, something happens, and one person starts clapping. Then another. Then more. Then everyone. IIRC, the *earliest this attested was in “Brubaker” (1980). In the 1974 Roy Campanella biopic “It’s Good to Be Alive,” there is a similar scene. Toward the end of the movie, after Winfield’s Campanella makes his first publica appearance in the baseball stadium. He chokes up after saying a few words. Then, one player starts clapping, then the others, etc. *Again, I can’t be sure since I can’t find any of the old threads.
