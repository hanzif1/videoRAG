The way I do this is by releasing the throttle and engine braking until I am no longer in correct speed range for my current gear, at which point I pull in clutch fully and coast my way to point where I want to reach, downshifting as needed. Now, I know coasting is bad (although I always downshift to stay in appropriate gear so cant understand why) and I would like to know what is the correct technique in this situation.

Yes, coming out on August 19th is the animated epic - “Kubo and the Two Strings”!! From Wikipedia - The story is set in ancient Japan, where a young boy named Kubo cares for his sick mother in a village. A spirit from the past turns Kubo’s life upside down by re-igniting an age-old vendetta. This causes all sorts of havoc as gods and monsters chase Kubo who, in order to survive, must locate a magical suit of armor once worn by his late father, a legendary Samurai warrior. Plus… Kubo has a shamisen!! Spreading the three-stringed fun! I can only think of one other film which featured a shamisen player, and that was the 2004 anime calle..."

Even then, she is rude to me!” “My son is a slob! He doesn’t seem to care at all about how he looks or how his apartment looks. I just don’t get it. I didn’t raise him to be like this.” It can be very painful to realize that the child you worked so hard to raise is not living up to their potential.

After the conclusion of the second world war, America was pervaded with hypermasculinity, deep levels of insecurity and a desperate need to regain the pre-war success of the 1920s.

I've noticed that bassists oftentimes slide their hand a few frets up/down between rests and then return to whichever note they're supposed to play. Is this a timing thing? Seems counterintuitive because you'd think you'd wanna stay ready to go on the next fret. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share New to Reddit?

It looks cool, and feels good…something like drawing on your guitar or something… Edit; If I take a closer look at myself, it is often when it seems quiet, it is not completely silent in the beginning,… and the movement is “in overdrive” a little ,…(more then necessary…sometime) Greetings,… 1 Like sairfingers January 13, 2023, 11:07am 3 In the same way that you keep your strumming hand moving up and down even when not hitting the strings I think perhaps it helps keep time and movement going when there’s a gap between chords, lick notes etc. 3 Likes R..."

What is it about slide guitar that has such an effect on people. Well, to me, I think it is because it is so vocal. The way that the slide moves from one note to another is very similar to how the voice can glide up and slide down seamlessly between notes. It speaks to us. We hear ourselves in it. To me it is similar to the way people react to a saxophone. It can cry, or scream, or even whisper. It’s a very versatile way to get your musical points across. There are so many great slide players to listen to and learn from. Where it’s Duane Allman, Bonnie Raitt, Ry Cooder, Derek Trucks, Sonny Landreth, Dickey Betts, or Keb Mo you can’t go wrong. Each of these players has or had their own very distinct sound that you can learn from and build upon. Playing ..."

However, when we find that our kids’ transition into adulthood isn’t happening the way we hoped, that responsibility can suddenly become a terrible burden. Whether it’s around the end of high school, during college, or some time in the years after, many young adults struggle to take the next step towards independence.

A subreddit dedicated to all things hamster related. Members • sin_biscuits_ Français中文 (繁體)Tiếng Việt Why is my hamster standing completely still? Question This might seem like an odd question, but I’ve never seen her do this before. I’ll attach the video. Normally she is very energetic, but when I just opened her cage she was standing like this and not moving at all for a solid minute straight. She let me pet her which she is typically very skittish about. Is this something I should be concerned about? Otherwise, she seems to be acting normally and is eating/drinking regularly. Also, does her eye look weird to anyone else? I did turn the light on when I entered my room, is it possible that I just scared her? Thanks for any advice. Since..."

April 20, 2014 By Greg Moskovitch While many have seen the clip of Pharrell getting teary when confronted with a montage of Happy tribute videos from around the world, few likely know that the “groundbreaking” 24-hour video for his smash hit single could just be an homage itself to a similar project from producer Girl Talk. As Consequence of Sound reports (via SPIN) in 2011, actress and dancer Anne Marsen starred in a 71-minute Kickstarter-funded music video project titled Girl Walk // All Day, which depicted her and others dancing freely around New York City to the entirety..."

The Reason Might Be Not What You Think. Many professional violinists experience occupational diseases, particularly Playing-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (PRMD). These issues might be caused by repetitive movements, poor posture, overuse. But there is one cause that majority of top musicians - young violinists, violin students, chamber violinists, orchestral and Baroque violinists, leaders, professors - haven't considered.

At least in my online research, they’re not as common as you might think. I just came across a fantastic website of digitized Etude magazines. Particularly awesome is a women’s issue from September 1901.

You remember it because it was important. It is important because you remember it. A first-of-its-kind collection, Do You Remember? A Collection of Firsts explores the ways in which our first times tell us who we are, who we might become, and most strikingly, who we’ve always been. In this millennial riff on Joe Brainard’s I Remember, Stephanie interrogates panic attacks, Finland, abortion, space flight, and a complicated relationship with water. Through precise and stunning prose, she asks curious and intrepid questions about childhood, home, grief, and the power of fear, all while inspiring readers to ask the..."

So dogs that are used to go on walks, whenever they see a leash, get very excited. You can even ask your pup to go get their leash and they would. I’ve also seen videos of dogs who stop walking when you drop their leash and give it back to you.

My husband is my best friend, a very loyal, honest and loving man before addiction took hold. My husband was practically teetotal before trying cocaine once when he was 30, given to him by a good friend on a day to watch the football. He soon became hooked but this was kept a secret from me for 4 years. He would use when me and my children were asleep in bed. All unknown to us.

Owens’s studio—whose boundaries blur into his office, showroom, furniture workshop, and apartment, which he shares with his partner of eighteen years, Michèle Lamy—takes up several stories of a Haussmannien townhouse in the upper reaches of the 7ème, on a quiet block south of the Seine. Besides having been the former headquarters of François Mitterrand and his staff, it‘s a space that’s been properly celebrated by the press, from PIN-UP to The Financial Times to the pages of this magazine—two years ago, 032c had Max Farago photograph Lamy’s daughter, nude, in the apartment.I arrived in the midst of the post-show buying rush, and the complex was ..."

I'll start: In one of my old apartments, I had my piano up against a shared wall. I honestly didn't think about the music being audible in my neighbor's place. And I played with abandon. A few months into my lease I get an unexpected knock on the door. In a place like Chicago (where I live), that's rarely a good sign. I look through the peephole and see an older woman and a younger man standing on the other side. With caution, I open the doorway and ask, \"Yes?\" \"Are you the person we can hear playing the piano?\" \"Uh....\" my gut dropped. I would play all hours of the night; improvising until 3am sometimes. \"Yes.\" \"Here,\" the older woman handed me ..."
