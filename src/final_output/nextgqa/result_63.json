I've noticed that men are often reluctant to shake my hand when my husband and I meet them or do business with them. For instance, the other day, my husband and I were at a furniture store when we were approached by a salesman who introduced himself and shook my husband's hand but not mine.

It was 1914, the summer after my brother, Dan, died in the west field and not long before America got into the First World War. I’ve never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day, and I never will. I’ve decided to write it down, though, in this book, which I will leave on the table beside my bed.

My dog has a tub of toys that he can take toys out of as he pleases. I usually leave about 10 toys in there, and I rotate them every week or so, and wash the ones that need it. He does play with his toys a lot, but by the end of the day, most of them are all over the house. I end up collecting them and putting them away. He is a fairly smart dog, so I am wondering, since he knows how to take the toys OUT and he sees me putting them back IN, would I be able to teach him to put his toys away?

GROWN-UPS GO HERE Issue 170: May 2020 A boy and a driver share their love for buses [Photo: SGTRANSPORT] A boy who loves buses grabbed the chance to talk to a bus driver who was on his way to work. ZACHARY JOHN writes about the warm exchange. Twelve-year-old Theodore Tan loves buses. When he boarded a Downtown Line train with his father, he did not realise the journey to Tampines would be a dream come true. Theodore sat down next to a man in an SMRT uniform.

My family and I would sit in the bus shelter waiting for the bus to arrive with a sense of positive anticipation of the trip we were going to take. However, on occasion we would wait and the bus would not arrive at the scheduled time; sometimes the bus was late and sometimes it did not come at all.

She had been travelling alone, her motives for being in the city unknown. No one knew her name, and no one would for the next sixty years. The Girl in Blue based on post-mortem photographs. Dressed entirely in blue, the woman walked the streets, greeting anyone she passed by with heartfelt warmth.

Suddenly, a glancing blow from the train sent her body hurtling through the air before she landed on the gravel siding.

Very small town America. It was nothing like that when I lived there, full of tattoo parlors and biker bars before any of that was cool. I stayed in a Bed and Breakfast during my recent visit so I could walk everywhere. I bought myself a gnome and a meteorite from local shops and every day I wrote and drank too much chai at a funky coffee shop that used to be the hardware store.Willoughby when I was a kid was practically designed to produce writers.

They learn what their child has taught them: if you make me uncomfortable, I’m going to make you uncomfortable. When a child ..."

Like Studying Homer in a “Damaged Manuscript” Raphael (1483–1520) is the most influential painter of the Italian Renaissance; his work embodies the balance, order, harmony and restraint of classicism.

He's a car enthusiast with an interest in auto mechanics and more specifically diesel mechanics. I usually trust what he has to say about cars, but on this one I'm interested to see what anyone else has to say. When I say floor it, I don't trying mean to achieve absurd speeds nor to just slam the pedal down all at once.

Eating, you can hold off for a few days, pooping is optional (for a while anyway), but peeing is right up there with breathing on the list of things you just gotta do each and every day. So when something happens to stem the flow of pee, trouble ensues - and fast. Pee is a funny little substance. It actually has lots of good stuff in it. Stuff you can’t live without in many cases – things like potassium and sodium and water. Your body, and more specifically, your kidneys, sense and adjust the composition of your bodily fluids and dump the excess into the urine. Just ate a super-sized order of fries with..."

She goes upstairs while we’re downstairs–it’s only ever if we’re on separate levels–and she yowls. Then she picks up a cat toy in her mouth while still vocalizing, carries the cat toy somewhere else, drops it, and yowls some more. As..."

Yesterday I did a 4 and a half mile run with an average pace of 9:50 per mile. I've been running seriously again for a few months now and this is a pretty typical pace for me.

Members • NicktheNickofNick Français When and how did giant pandas start only eating bamboo and stop reproducing effectively? Biology Please note I'm not asking why pandas are dying out, I'm more interested in the specifics of these two questions. I've read that pandas aren't naturally evolved to survive on bamboo like they do, so when did this become the case? Secondly, at what point did pandas cease to reproduce effectively, ie. start declining in numbers without direct intervention by other animals (eg through hunting)? Finally, I suppose, what role did humans play in either of these two changes? Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share New to Reddit? Create ..."

Pandas have to eat up to 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. Feeding goes on day and night, with the..."

While their famous black and white fur pattern might stand out to us, it is actually used for camouflage. The white sections help them blend into snowy surroundings during winter, and the dark black fur helps them disappear in the shade of trees in summer.While pandas are known for their clumsy and lazy behaviour often observed in captivity or during feeding, they are actually proficient tree climbers and swimmers. However, they do also spend a lot of time sitting around eating bamboo. It can take as long as 12 hours a day for a panda to eat the amount of bamboo it needs to get enough nutrients.Though bamboo makes up most of a panda’s diet, their bodies are ..."

They know that they must shake hands with their opponent after a match, and they know that losing their temper on the strip is strictly forbidden.

I once watched a coach give a lesson to a young fencer. The coach would open a line, the student would start his lunge, and the coach would step backward. The student would stretch his lunge and hit the coach. This action was repeated a number of times: the coach cuing and the student lunging to score. Occasionally the coach would suddenly make a parry and riposte against the student's attack. Lighting fast, the student would parry the riposte and counter-riposte to score. At one point in the lesson, after a particularly fast and accurate riposte by the student, another fencer watching the lesson turned to me and said: \"What an am..."

An outraged Hitler had 50 of them shot, an appalling abrogation of the Geneva Convention, to which Germany was a signatory. Twenty-three were reincarcerated. Only three made it all the way to freedom—a Dutchman and two Norwegians, all flyers with the British Royal Air Force. Here's their remarkable story, which begins at the Sagan railway station. For locations of relevant towns, consult our map.

And a woman was there who for eighteen years had been crippled by a spirit; she was bent over, completely incapable of standing erect. When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said, “Woman, you are set free of your infirmity.” He laid his hands on her, and she at once stood up straight and glorified God. But the leader of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured on the Sabbath, said to the crowd in reply, “There are six days when work should be done. Come on those days to be cured, not on the Sabbath day.” The Lord said to him in reply, “Hypocrites! Does n..."

Her story is a story about visibility — about who gets noticed, who is ignored, and how Christ restores dignity to those the world overlooks. In a week when asylum seekers have once again been targeted and made invisible, her story feels all the more urgent. Here’s the sermon I prepared for two small Warwickshire congregations, about seeing as Jesus sees, and learning to be seen ourselves. 10th Sunday after Trinity, (Proper 10C) – Readings: Isaiah 58:9b-end, Luke 13:10-17 I don’t know about you, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen this woman before,this woman who has been crippled and bent fo..."

I’m a weirdo who is completely obsessed with dogs, and I have a bad habit of searching for the word “dog” on Netflix and watching whatever absolute garbage turns up. I think last week’s pick was Snow Buddies, the second movie in the indomitable direct-to-video Air Bud spinoff franchise about talking holiday puppies. I’m not terribly selective with my laundry-folding films, as long as they feature a dog (especially many dogs), despite the fact that I make my living hanging out with dozens of cool shelter dogs every day. So I assumed that the film was schlocky German Shepherd Hero matinee fodder for 80s tweens — gee, a racist dog… who is literally a white dog?? lol — and pressed play. White Dog, adapted from the autobiographical novel of the same name by French author Romain Gary, is the story..."

Veigel December 10, 2020 As I understand it, in the spring of 2010 a woman spotted a white male dog trying to navigate a four lane highway. Worried that the dog would be killed by an oncoming car she somehow managed to lure him into the back of her vehicle by enticing him with food. The dog had “T3” painted on his sides. He was filthy, starving, had bite scars on his face and a split ear.

Since she had become pregnant three months ago, she squealed at the same time every night as though she were hungry. The stillness of the night air would make her sharp, dreadful cries even more deafening. I would reluctantly pull myself out of bed to check on her, using the small kerosene lamp. Its flame flickered and shone brighter on those warm summer nights. I often found her standing on her hind legs behind the wooden fence, grunting joyfully when she spotted me. She was a black Creole pig with a bright yellow tag adorning her left ear. She was the only pig I had, my only hope, on which I relied to provide for me and..."

They can communicate with their eyes before they begin to move or talk. For instance, babies use their eyes to explore the wonders of the world from birth. They do this, even before they learn to grab with their hands, crawl, or sit up. The eyes of a baby provide important information and stimulation for their development. Although babies are not born with all of the visual abilities that are required in life, they still learn how to properly make use of their eyes over time. They also learn how to use the visual ..."
