The Deeper Meaning Behind a Performer's Bow The lights go dim, and the theatre is silent as the audience waits with bated breath. Is that it? Is the show over?

The clapping from the audience fills the theatre while the performers execute their last cue for the night: they bow. An unspoken agreement between audience and actor, the curtain call and bow is the time to show thanks for the work done on stage as well as the audience for appreciating it. T..."

Most of the people I had read about who were pray-ers were also kneel-ers. For example, a second-century Christian named Hegesippus records that James, the half-brother of Jesus, “was frequently found situated upon his knees asking forgiveness for the people, so that his knees became hard after the manner of a camel, on account of always bending down upon a knee while worshipping God and asking forgiveness for the people.”[1] ..."

It's an interesting and fun thing to do, basically designing a system and going trough all the small things needed to make it work. I can see how today this itch can be scratched by many different videogames (Factorio, just to give one example), while decades ago it was either model train or nothing much else.I think younger generations are drawn to cheaper and easier to access forms of entertainment that provide similar intellectual experience. It's a shame for the hobby, but I find it a very reasonable thing to happen.dylan604 on Jan 16, 2024 | parent | next [–] Se..."

As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was instantly drawn to the film by Daniel Radcliffe’s role in it, but the gothic haunted house trope certainly caught my attention.

If you haven’t read my review, it’s here. First of all, what’s in a name? Kneale changed the name of his hero from Kipps to Kidd, apparently because writer Susan Hill took Kipps’ name from an HG Wells story. The name of the woman in black has also changed. In the book she is Jennet Humfrye; in the film her surname is now Goss, though I keep seeing people claiming her first name is still Jennet. I’m not so sure; her name is pronounced Janet in the 1989 film, and when Arthur finds the gr..."

Romanticism, Modernism, and Early Science Fiction Search for: H. G.

Halfway down the precipitous path to the Pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man sitting in an attitude of profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock. The hands of this man hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and staring before him, and his face was wet with tears. He glanced round at Isbister’s footfall. Both men were disconcerted, Isbister the more so, and, to override the awkwardness of his involuntary pause, he remarked, with an air of mature conviction, that the weather was hot for the time of year. “Very,” answered ..."

Readers often ask “whatever became of . . . ?” and name a writer whose books they loved. There’s no one answer, of course, but since many writers I know say they can’t not write, even if they have no hope of being published, and claim they will only stop writing when you pry their cold dead fingers from the keyboard, it’s a puzzle worth examining. That “cold dead fingers” is one answer. Writers aren’t immortal, although their books do live on after them. Poor health can also end a writer’s career. Those reasons aside, why do some writers simply disappear? For the purposes of this post, my focus is on w..."

Misanthropy is a general hatred, mistrust, or contempt of humanity, and a misanthrope is someone who holds such views. It is based on the flaws of mankind and can be expressed through emotions or judgments. It can be directed at all humans or exclude a few idealized people. Misanthropy can take on many forms, from destructive to constructive, and can range from actively trying to hurt or improve humanity, or to simply resigning from society and mocking the absurdity of the human condition.
