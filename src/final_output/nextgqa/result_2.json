                "detail": "If your baby is attempting to crawl backward and ends up under the sofa instead of moving forward, try this technique to support the next motor milestone - belly crawling. Place your baby’s toe (the inner side of your baby’s foot) on the floor and wait for active movement. In my experience, this is the fastest way to teach a baby how to move forward. This works better with bare feet because your baby gains a sensory advantage when feeling the floor beneath them. If one leg appears weaker than the other, focus more on exercising that leg to prevent asymmetrical belly crawling. Enjoy practicing belly crawling!

Like most new mums, I struggled with sleep deprivation when my first born was an infant. I wanted what every parent dreams of – a full night’s sleep. The fact is that more than 50% of parents struggle to have a full night’s sleep until their baby’s third year. Fortunately, there is a way to beat the statistics. Evidence-based research reveals the secret to why (and how) some babies sleep through the night within the first year. Sound like a dream come true? Then keep reading… What is baby self-soothing? Baby self-soothing is when your baby can calm and settle themselves back to sleep again without needing to be fed to sleep, pacifi..."

I am afraid to say, I am sure, how many ancestors the baron had; but I know that he had a great many more than any other man of his time; and I only wish that he had lived in these latter days, that he might have had more. It is a very hard thing upon the great men of past centuries, that they should have come into the world so soon, because a man who was born three or four hundred years ago, cannot reasonably be expected to have had as many relations before him, as a man who is born now. The last man, whoever he is - and he may be a cobbler or some low vulgar dog for aught we know - will have a longer pedigree than the greatest nobleman now alive; ..."

What used to be a cringe dad look is now in style. But the history of shorts is much older: the earliest known example of shorts can be found as early as the 1800s in the uniforms of the Nepalese military. However, the concept of men's shorts as we know them today was born in a tea house on Bermuda Island during World War I. Pretty random, right? Learn all about the history of shorts and how they made their way from a small tea house in Bermuda, to all over the world. The history of shorts: World War I You're probably wondering about the seemingly random fact that shorts were invented in a small tea house in Bermuda. The reason for that was that British soldiers set up their Nor..."

I’ve written in the past about how to choose a highchair for your baby but one of the questions I get asked about all the time is what you can do to help your little one if they don’t want to stay put in it.  Now, how you handle this might depend on your highchair – once babies are older they generally move to highchairs that they can safely get in and out of themselves.

But where did the paper bag get its roots? How did it rise to popularity as a grocery bag, lunch bag, and retail shopping bag? Let’s find out! What did people use before the invention of paper bags? It seems they mostly used reusable and durable vessels like baskets, canvas bags, burlap bags, or woven bags.

Conduct of a bout A bout starts with the referee calling the fencers “on-guard.” They  face each other behind their start lines in the on-guard position.
