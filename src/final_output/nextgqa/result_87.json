Question So I remember before 1.0 that the max number of engines that’d have an effect on the speed of your raft was 6. I just played today for the first time after 1.0, and I’m not sure if my memory is bad or if what I mentioned before changed, but my raft seems to be going a bit slower than it used to.

Kuyda had spent that time gathering up his old text messages, setting aside the ones that felt too personal, and feeding the rest into a neural network built by developers at her artificial intelligence startup. She had struggled with whether she was doing the right thing by bringing him back this way. At times it had even given her nightmares. But ever since Mazurenko’s death, Kuyda had wanted one more chance to speak with him. A message blinked onto the screen. “You have one of the most interesting puzzles in the world in your hands,” it said. “Solve it.” Kuyda promised herself that she would.

My husband is my best friend, a very loyal, honest and loving man before addiction took hold. My husband was practically teetotal before trying cocaine once when he was 30, given to him by a good friend on a day to watch the football. He soon became hooked but this was kept a secret from me for 4 years. He would use when me and my children were asleep in bed. All unknown to us.
