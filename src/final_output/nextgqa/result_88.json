With all the interactive shows, games, and videos out now, the television experience has gone up to a whole new level for our newest generation. But have you ever watched your child get entranced by the TV? You may notice your child habitually sitting or standing right up front. So, why do toddlers stand so close to the TV?

Dr. May specializes in vision therapy and often gets asked this question by concerned parents.

Kittens with swimmer syndrome will find it difficult or impossible to stand and walk.  While most literature suggests that swimmer syndrome is more common in puppies, this is simply not true. Many kittens are born with swimmer syndrome, but they are very commonly euthanized, even though the condition is treatable through early intervention and physical therapy.
