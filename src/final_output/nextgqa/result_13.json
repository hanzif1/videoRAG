We have less awareness of what a particular body zone is doing physically the further away it is from our head. If we pay limited attention most of us will be aware of our facial expressions and gestures. Even those less adept can readily simulate a staged smile or frown on command to evoke an emotion for someone else though other subtle gestural clues in conflict might give you away.

A good photographer will alleviate stress, keep things comfortable and fun, and give you small posing tips during the session.

My daughter said that lately, guys always slip their hand under hers, which makes her feel like she is the dominant person in the relationship.  I told her in my generation, the man’s hand was always on top, he was the protector… at least that is how I have always known it to be.

Both cages are of decent sizes, and at first my tiel was nervous and wouldn’t make much noise but after i came back home from going out, he’s definitely more active and making noises. However, i notice him pacing side to side or climbing up on the side of the cage next to my budgies (they don’t care they’re just doing their own thing), so i’m just wondering if i need to cover that side until he settles in or if they will help him feel..."

I’ve started analysing some of Paganini’s works and have already gotten so many fresh ideas e.g. ascending arpeggios and descending with scales, chromatic scales, pedal tones etc. Does anyone have any more suggestions on some things classical violin players tend to do?

Indeed, more and more kids are living at home with their parents well into their 20s and beyond. And, most concerning, more and more of those kids are idle and going nowhere fast. Unfortunately, today’s kids don’t like making sacrifices and parents don’t like making their kids make sacrifices. And the sad irony of this situation is that the misery of being an unmotivated adult child is far worse than the misery of getting a job and learning to live independently. In the end, we need to teach our kids that accepting life’s responsibilities is much easie..."

Spoilers false I recently re-watched Jeoffrey & Margaery's wedding, and I was wondering at what point Olenna got the poison into Jeoffrey's cup? I watched carefully and saw her remove the poison from Sansa's necklace, which I had missed when I watched it previous times, but I still don't see at what point the poison gets into Jeoffery's cup. The Strangler (the poison used on Jeoffery) was a very fast acting poison, which means that Jeoffery would have had to have drank it just before he died. The only problem is, I don't see Olenna get anywhere near his cup after Tyrion refills it. My best guess is that Olenna passed off the poison to M..."

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave -2USD for a porter or housekeeper.Punctual..."

You guessed it, someone who’s ‘down to earth’. It’s also one of the most common attributes people associate with themselves. But, what does it really mean? Is everyone really so down to earth, or is it just an empty statement to help score a right swipe on Tinder? There’s no doubt that men love down to earth women, just like you probably look for the quality in men you date.
