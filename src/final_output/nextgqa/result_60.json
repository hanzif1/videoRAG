Members • gloveisallyouneed Русский PSA: I’ve been doing bicycle hand-signals wrong So after 20 years of cycling in Amsterdam, I’ve just found out that I’ve been doing a hand-signal wrong! In the UK (and by extension I assumed also in Ireland, but that assumption also fell by the wayside today!) you stick out the right hand and wave it up-and-down to indicate that you’re planning to stop.

For almost a decade, we’d been going on rides of increasingly epic lengths. When he was eight, we did a 14-mile trip; the next year, 28 miles. We kept on bumping it up and up until he was a freshman in high school and we did our first “century”, 100 miles in a day.By that summer of 2022, we dared ourselves to go further, longer, and more intensely than ever. So we picked Montreal as an ambitious destination — it’s about 450 miles from our house in Brooklyn. We plotted a route where we’d go 10..."

Giant Alice upsets the jury (literally) `Oh, I beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die. `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- all,' he repeated wi..."

Members • Mykle1984 Tiếng ViệtFrançaisРусский How did they hid the camera in this mirror shot in “The Best Years of Our Lives” (1946) Discussion I watched this on the big screen for the first time and this take blew my mind. I can’t figure out how they hid the camera in this scene, it starts when they go in the ladies room. There are 5 camera movements switching between 3 mirrors all in one take and I can’t figure out how they hid the camera. My wife thought it was doubles but the actor and the reflections blink at the same time. This might be one of my new favorite shots. It is really good and subtle. Read more Share New to Reddit?

For many people, looking at a baby can trigger a whole host of instincts and other pleasant physical and emotional changes. But it's definitely not something everyone experiences.It can be tough for some to imagine feeling a rush of emotions towards a baby, especially since not everyone has maternal instincts. And that's OK. If you feel like you don't want kids, or don't enjoy being around babies, that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you — or even that you couldn't take care of a baby, if you chose to do so.That said, for some folks, seeing a baby can make them feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and it often kick..."

This might sound weird, but I’ve always been baffled by how people react to babies. It’s not that I dislike babies or anything. I just don’t feel that instinctive “aww” reaction. I don't melt and I don't think like wow I want one of those. I think kids are cute and funny when they get a bit older and do/say silly things, but babies just don't do anything for me. Animals make my heart explode. Spotting dogs, watching cats do literally anything, and pretty much any other interaction with an animal gives me this rush of emotion, I guess how people feel when they see a baby. I wonder if it stems from me not particularly wanting kids, or an indication that I definitely don't. If you’re someone who..."

That your mama bear fierceness will kick in and life will be magical as your heart explodes with oxytocin. But is that the reality?

Exhausted, sweaty, yet somehow glowing and perfectly groomed (even her hair looks artfully bedraggled), the new mother reaches for her infant (usually played by, like, a five month old) and beams pure love. I'm not going to say that's inaccurate (minus the whole looking awesome and delivering a five month old thing), but the fact that this is the only reaction a new mom has. What it really feels like to meet your baby for the first time can, and usually is, a far cry from the cinematic depictions we're used to.After the birth of my first, I was elated.

Sam seems to have normal life, but he has a mass on the left side of his face that makes it hard for him to breathe and talk. Photo credit: Benjamin Brink The four part story summarizes the surgeries that Sam had at birth, and in between his eight grade and freshman year to reduce the mass on his face. I believe that Hallman Jr’s writing does deserve the Pulitzer Prize.This story reads as if it were a script of a medical documentary following Sam’s life. It keeps you reading to find out if the surgery was successful or not. There is also a lot of emotion through the story. “The Boy Behind the Mask” does not have that many parts that the reader wants to skim through. The p..."

As teenagers and as young adults we felt that we were unique and felt that our clothing style, our sense of fashion, choice of music, in fact, every aspect was very distinct. We often ridiculed our parents’ thoughts and practices. We rebelled against our parents and, most importantly, we felt that we were the master of our own destiny and ‘self-made’.What if this was not true? It would be shocking. This song shares such a revelation.Welcome my son, welcome to the machineWhere have you been?It’s alright we know where you’ve beenYou’ve been in the pipeline, filling in timeProvided with toys and ‘scouting for boys’You brought a guitar to punish your maAnd you didn’t like school, and youKnow you’re nobody..."

If your director/animation supervisor/lead tells you do something that contradicts this, do that.] Bird flight is notoriously hard to animate convincingly, and there are many reasons for this. The action is very fast, but even in slow motion it is often hard to understand what's happening underneath because the bones are concealed by feathers, plus the movement is completely alien to us, it's not something we can act out or get a feel for. When investigated thoroughly, many things about flight seem odd, even counterintuitive. Over the years I've animated quite a few birds and have slowly gained a rudimentary knowledge of the dynamics and biomechanics of flight, as well as how to apply some of the traditional animation tricks to it. So, here are my..."

A multitude of organisms of all shapes and sizes, from tiny hymenoptera weighing less than 0.2 mg to enormous pterosaurs weighing up to several hundred kg, have animated or are animating the sky for more than 250 million years. By the diversity of their sizes and flight techniques, birds  became masters in the evolution of flights as sophisticated as the hovering flight of the hummingbirds or the lightning swoops of a hawk pursuing its prey.

Giving Advice I just finished the book and thought it had some great tips. It’s not a PUA book, it’s based on his “Love Lab” research and he claims these points are empirically the best advice to give. Some highlights: Women value trustworthiness and want to trust that they’ll be safe, physically, emotionally, and sexually, even in one-night-stand situations. The way you build trust is by genuinely listening and asking questions about their interests. Don’t go in with an agenda, don’t fake who you are, don’t try to make impressions, just listen and build trust. Being intelligent (hu..."

I believe they make life infinitely better just by existing in your presence. As I write this, my 15-pound mop of fluff, Montana, is sitting on my legs making them go numb, and I'm not moving her.

Now, in the 2011 film, we are shown that it cannot recreate inorganic matter. This is a major plot point of the film.

Has anyone's kid ever done this? She just started doing it a couple months ago - she always has to be holding a toy and it always has to be red. She has no other weird \"quirks\" - I was just wondering if this was a sensory issue or a funny toddler thing. I try not to google anything as everything points to some \"disorder\" and quite frankly I'm getting sick of the pressure on children these days. It's terrifying for the parents and I often wonder if it's just a way to create jobs for people but I digress.

Many parents at Te Ōki notice this behaviour and wonder: why does my child always have something in their hands?It might look like habit or even hoarding—but it’s actually full of meaning.

You feel that love when your dog wags their whole body once you walk in the door, or when your cat curls up in your lap and purrs for hours.

You see a lot of rescue videos on social media, often times the animal obviously being grateful by licking the rescuer, snuggling them, and wagging their tail. But how do they know how to express their affection in such ways? Is it genetic to know how to do this or learned behavior?

Sure, we get taught the biology of sex, the legal ins and outs of marriage, and maybe we read a few obscure love stories from the 19th century on how not to be an ass-face.Without clear ideas from adults, what we’re left with is basically trial and error, and if you’re like most people, it’s mostly error.Enter: a string of toxic relationships as we fumble through an already complex dating world.One of the problems is that a lot of toxic relationship habits are baked into our culture.

Written by Lucy Robinson in Trivia I was watching a documentary the other day about wild horses and as soon as a captured horse was released he’d rush off seemingly knowing exactly where he was going, even if he’d been released in unfamiliar territory. This started me thinking about if horses can independently find their way home.

In fact, it has been suggested that body language makes up 55% of communication, with the other 45% consisting of tone and words.While many nonverbal cues can be interpreted the same way regardless of gender, men often stand, gesture, and use their eyes in specific ways. A man’s body language can provide additional insights into his attitude and feelings that may not be conveyed by his words.

I like how in Wes Anderson's new movie there are layers to the story. We start with the girl reading the book, then we listen to the author who wrote the book, and then the author goes to the Zero who tells him the story. What is the significance of the girl and her visiting the author's memorial at the end? It made me a bit sad but I didn't know what it meant.

In More Than a Footnote: Canadian Women You Should Know (Second Story Press), acclaimed, veteran journalist Karin Wells seeks to share a holistic – and fascinating – perspective of our country's most interesting, innovative, and iconoclastic contributors, bringing the women who have often been overlooked to the foreground.

Men often have a different way of processing emotions and they may not feel the same need to open up emotionally to women as women do to men.In fact, too much emotional openness from a man can potentially destabilize a romantic relationship.Now, let me be clear: men are not robots, men are human and men have emotions. The difference lies in how men typically experience, process and manage their emotions.This doesn’t mean a man shouldn’t open up to anyone — friends, family, mentors, or a therapist. The..."

Unwelcome Habits I have a 10mo old cat who loves to jump on the counter when i'm not around, both kitchen and bathroom counters. In the kitchen, there's nothing he wants up there, except for the occasional milk lid ring if I don't throw it away immediately. I know he jumps up other times because i've seen the paw prints on my glass stove top. For the most part, he follows me around and so will be hanging out with me if I've just cooked, but i'm scared of him jumping up onto a hot stove. But ..."
