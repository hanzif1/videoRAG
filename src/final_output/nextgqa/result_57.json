Members • MusicSoundListener Русский中文 (繁體)Tiếng ViệtFrançais Please help me find this meme/viral video of three people dancing, the lady dancing is all wrong Open I can't find this video anywhere. It starts close in one guy doing a dance left to right. The camera opens up a bit and we see the second guy, dancing a bit off tempo, but not totally off. Then the camera opens up more and we see an old lady dancing totally off, really off tempo. This is a funny video that got viral a few weeks ago, everyone was re-posting with a different text like AMD versus Intel, When I go to the gym, stuff like that. It's silly but I'm trying to find for hours and I can't. Thanks everyone! Read more Archived post. New comments ca..."

Members • Divochironpur Русский The nicest feeling is someone covering you with a blanket when you take a nap Random Thought I was extremely tired and had fallen asleep on the couch. My colleague, who was training for night flights, saw me asleep from outside. He took off his work boots, came inside, covered me with a blanket, put my phone on charge and left a bottle of water on the table. He then put his work boots on left and left. I never nap and I was surprised to find a blanket when I woke up, so I checked the security cameras. I’ve only known my colleague for 2 days but his kindness touched my heart.

Both these writers belong to marginalised communities and talk about their experiences of discrimination in their childhood. Zitkala – Sa relates how she was taken away from her mother to be introduced into a school run by white Americans. She remembers her first day at Carlisle Indian school when the people who run the school force her to cut her hair. She feels anguish and helplessness as she is completely opposed to that action. Long hair is considered a symbol of courage and well-being in her culture. The other autobiographical episode is written by Bama who learns about the social injustice imposed upon her community t..."

It was a perfect fit since they wanted a lifestyle/documentary newborn session and that is where my focus has been shifting. At the time of the photographs the baby was 5 weeks old. Before we started mom warned me that the baby had been colicky, and wouldn’t you know we couldn’t wake that baby up. The parents really wanted some awake photographs and a few of them interacting with the baby. It took a little while to wake him up from his sound sleep. At the session we incorporated a few items that ..."

If you have booked a studio newborn session, but aren’t able to come into the studio before baby turns 3-weeks old (such as an extended stay in the NICU), your session will automatically be converted to an older newborn one.

But preparing to speak in this particular hotel banquet room, with fewer than 50 people in attendance, I shuddered unexpectedly. The reason: I was the only person in the room with a Y chromosome.

Members • maclloyd6 中文 (繁體)Tiếng Việt Baby wakes when put down Advice Needed My LO is 3 mo old and wakes up every time I try and put him down. It doesn’t matter if I do it slow, if I put him on his side and roll him slowly to his back, if I shush him, etc. He will sleep for 15 minutes max before waking up and yelling. He’s also a contact napper. This has led to a lot of co sleeping (we do the safe sleep 7) just so everyone can actually get some sleep. As much as i love the co sleeping snuggles, I want the space in my bed back. It would also be nice to get things done while he naps. So please give me all the tips and tricks to put him down without him waki..."

One such film was The Boy, which tells the tale of a seemingly sentient doll named Brahms. Now, a horror movie is never complete without a good twist, and I have to say, the surprise at the end of The Boy is one of the most insane reveals I've experienced in a long, long time. I already spoke about the twist in an interview with the film's star, Lauren Cohan, but I thought it might be fun to break it down piece by piece. So if you're morbidly curious and don't mind the spoiler, keep reading to find out the real truth about Brahms. PS, There’s MorePS, There’s MoreYou Can't Call Yourself a Horror Movie Bu..."

Biting and Teething I'm on week 4 with my pup and have been redirecting since I got her at 8 weeks and will occasionally do reverse time-outs (but she doesn't seem to really care about that unfortunately) and she still gets very bitey. If all else fails I crate her for a nap. Those that have used this method, how long did it take to sink in? Am I not doing something right if it's taking this long or is it a long process?

In the United States, where the Protestant work ethic took the deepest root, even Sabbath observance was shaped by the belief that unproductive time required moral justification. Writing in the early 1930s, Bertrand Russell warned that “immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous.” By 1948, the German philosopher Josef Pieper offered a more forceful philosophical defense of leisure. His book Leisure: The Basis of Culture, published in the wake of one of the largest labor strike waves in US history, pushed back against what he called the tyranny of “total work,” a condition in which the modern human is reduced to their measurable productivity. If leisure needs any justification at all, it can be found in the breakthroughs it enables: Darwin doin..."

Discussion I know this is a silly question but curious to know if how active or kicking your baby was in utero translated once they were born? For example, if baby was super active/kicking all the time, was baby more fussy, active when born? If baby didn’t kick much and lounged around, were they chill/loungey when they were born? My mom mentioned that I barely kicked/moved around and I was a lay-low personality and chill/quiet baby apparently. My sister did somersaults with my mom and she cried a lot/fussy/..."

I would quote what I said, but my attempt at a joke sputtered out of me so poorly that I’m not even sure it made sense.

Her friend advises her to submit to her husband, explaining that in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus teaches that we are to “turn the other cheek.” But is that Jesus’ meaning? Is he really teaching people to remain passive in situations of abuse? Jesus’ instruction to turn the other cheek, found in Matthew 5:39, actually means to turn the tables on those who seek to harm us and to overcome evil through creative acts of nonviolent resistance. Jesus is not claiming we should never resist those who seek to harm us. In fact, that would contradict the Hebrew Bible’s principle of lex talionis, which Jesus quotes: “an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth..."

Answer In Matthew 5:38–39, Jesus says, “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.” The concept of “turning the other cheek” is a difficult one for us to grasp. Allowing a second slap after being slapped once does not come naturally. In the section of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount in which He commands us to turn the other cheek, He addresses the ..."

The Women by Kristin Hannah… does it get better? I actually bought a copy of The Women by Kristin Hannah as my library had several month’s wait to get a loan. I should say I LOVED The Nightingale and The Great Alone, both by Hannah. But I’m about 100 pages into The Women (which I also think is a bad title) and I am REALLY disappointed. It’s reading like something a high schooler wrote. The main character decides she “can be a hero” and ships overseas to Vietnam in the first chapter. Her voice feels inauthentic in its simplicity and the exposition poorly paced. It doesn’t seem possible to me that the same author as The Nightingale or The Gr..."

However, I’d been meaning to read it for a while. I actually bought myself a copy of the German while still at school – the book is short, and at the time I thought that I’d have plenty of time, energy, and desire to read German literature in the original language. I read the first few pages and gave up. But now my German’s better and I do, sometimes, read things in that language now, and even occasionally enjoy doing so. Still, I was in Russia, and my German copy is at home, so I read Der Vorleser in English on my Kindle to save myself time.

Don't Writing Advice Why less planning could mean more for your next story. It seems an essential question to aspiring writers, who are eager to mimic the habits and behaviors of those they admire. Unfortunately, just like what our favorite writers eat for breakfast, whether they write before or after they shower, and whether they use pencils of word processors, just because a method of book preparation works for one writer, it won’t necessarily work for another. You will hear writers tell you they never start until they have ten scenes plotted on a timeline and character sketches for all their primary characters. You’ll also encounter writers who tell you they never intend to start a new novel, the story just winds its way there. There are lots of degrees of plotting, planning and pre-writing, and for the newer novelist, extensive outlining can be helpful. There is nothing more comfo..."
