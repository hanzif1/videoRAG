For mothers and would-be-moms of all shapes and sizes, there’s no time to rest and relax, because the sunrise can be both a blessing and a curse for the creatures of the day. Sweltering temperatures make finding a cool drink a deadly imperative. Mugger crocodiles lurk beneath the surface of waterholes, while lions, tigers and bears stalk the forests. For a Bengal tigress feeding her family is her biggest concern, while Indian antelope and Asiatic lions have mating on their mind. Not everyone will survive this Mother’s Day, in the hours from dawn to dusk. #Crocodiles #Wildlife #Animals | Love Nature"

When determining how to introduce cats to dogs, remember that each animal is unique.

Have at least two people present — one to handle the dog’s leash and the other to tend to the cat.  In the initia..."

We recommend using easy grip utensils to ease your little ones into it.

They learn skills they can use in their adult lives, like preparing meals, cleaning, organising and gardening.Being involved in chores also gives children experience of relationship skills like communicating clearly, negotiating, cooperating and working as a team.And when children contribute to family life, they might feel competent and responsible.

I’ve learned that this is simply not true. Ducks only paddle to change direction, or to move forward. Ducks have a gland at the base of their tails that secretes an oil that they spread on their feathers to keep from sinking. The waterfowl will frequently tuck their head and bill to help sleek the oil over their plumage to remain above the surface. But sometimes, the oil gland gets plugged. Stress or trauma can be one reason. It is suggested that to help ease the stress, that the duck might need a reprieve, some down time from others to recover.

Ducks perform several activities while they are in water: Swimming: Ducks use their webbed feet to paddle and move smoothly through the water. Feeding: They often dabble, which means they tip forward in the water to reach plants, insects, and small fish below the surface. Preening: Ducks clean and arrange their feathers using their beaks to keep them waterproof and in good condition. Floating and resting: Ducks can float on water to rest or stay safe from predator..."

Posted on June 7, 2022June 7, 2022 by Live & Learn The River Thames is beautiful in early summer, and the stretch just upstream of central London is full of birds: motionless herons watching for fish, bustling moorhens poking around the submerged plants, and watchful flocks of preening swans. But as my canoe club paddles along the river, we’re always looking out for our clear favorites: the mother ducks with a fluffy cluster of ducklings tagging along behind. When they’re lingering at the shore, it all looks slightly chaotic, with baby birds dawdling and exploring as the mother duck keeps an eye on them. But when it’s time to move on, chaos shifts into order as the ducklings line up behind the adult and the convoy moves o..."

You’ve heard the little inspirational quote about how serene a duck looks on the surface, but underneath he’s paddling like hell. It’s supposed to mean that you should never assume successful people find it easy, that if you just work hard enough and try to look good doing it, you can be successful too. But it’s not true. Ducks don’t stay afloat by paddling like hell. They stay afloat because they’re shaped like a boat and they’re waterproof. So much for inspiration. You too could float if you had the right shape and happened to be waterproof. Just like you could be a ballerina if you were sk..."

Technical I can't help but notice that most of the camera angles are more focused on the driver in the car rather than the marvel of engineering that the cars can do on track. Love the sport. Been watching forever, but without technical analysis I can't tell if the driver is nailing the corner or failing based of a close up of the driver in a cockpit.

Only object A can control object B. In control theory books, vector y is the observable output. Unfortunately, not all control from object A can be observed. I wonder what would be a good way to describe such a system. I see 2 options: Manage states of objects A and B together and have control from A to B also be part of the state x. Define a control equation for the link from A to B. But this is troubling since some variables will also be observable (i.e. part of y). Read more Share New to Reddit? Create ..."
