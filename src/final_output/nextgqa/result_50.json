And my choice of CAD is GH - reason I got the CNC in the first place. Long story short, I had no idea what i got into… But trying to do a pro job as possible, here are some pictures I made of this project so far. Started in March 2023. The commission is for a Lespaul (no year given - but not a hollow body) - And at first impossible to find a perfect 3D model that is based on reality - so I started with a simpler model where I found the right plans - 1950’s style plans! Glad I took Industrial design drafting 101 (35 years ago!) Anyway the program evolved and later added option to change the body, the neck, the head, fret scales and insets, etc etc etc… And all CNC friendly… The hardest part to do was the neck… 2023-03-31 17_08_25-Telecaster 1.0.3dm (6 MB) - Rhinoceros 7 Commercial1115×806 141 KB ..."

Members • sunggishin Tiếng Việt Why do some women exclusively pump without breastfeeding ? Question So, I'm trying to watch as much as I can before actually giving birth and having to care for a newborn, just to have a rough idea and project myself a little bit. And in a lot of videos, I see mothers having a very precise pumping schedule (like 10 to 20' every 2-3 hours) but never actually breastfeed. And I wonder why? It seems obvious because they never explain it but it's nebulous to me. What are the possible reasons and what am I missing? Edit: thanks to everyone who has taken the time to reply. The amount of response is overwhelming and I was definitely missing A LOT of things! I had no idea so many factors could lead ..."

So how do you know what your feathered friend is thinking and feeling? Reading bird body language, from head bobbing to sounds to flapping wings, can help you to not only understand what your pet is feeling, but also develop a stronger bond with them. Some actions can even tell you when they’re sick or injured. We spoke with two pet bird experts to decode parrot body language, from physical movements to vocalizations: Dr. Karen Rosenthal, DVM, director of exotic companion animal education for Veterinary Emergency Group in New York City. Dr. Laurie Hess, DVM, an avian and exotic pet veterinarian and owner of the Veterinary Center for Birds and Exotics in Bedford Hills, New York. How D..."

Built over the course of a year, CARA is easily my most dynamic and well-designed quadruped yet. Unlike most quadrupeds, CARA doesn’t use any gears or pulleys. Instead, her joints are driven by rope through capstan drives. CARA is also the second quadruped ever to use capstan drives, following Stanley. If you’re unfamiliar with how capstan drives work, I’ve made a 20-minute video — High Precision Speed Reducer Using Rope — that explains everything you need to know. CARA builds directly on what I covered in that video. Capstan drives offer several advantages: zero backlash, high torque transparency, low inertia, low cost, and quiet operation. These qualities make them an ideal speed reducer for robotics. Finding the Exact 8:1 Gear RatioThe sta..."

Members • mrafinch Tiếng Việt Fellow commuters using the train, why do you follow it up the platform? I commute with the train to work and I've noticed in the last few years people acting a little strange when it arrives at the platform and was wondering, what on earth are you guys doing? The train arrives at the platform and obviously will need to come to a complete stop to allow passengers to alight and board. As the train gets to a certain speed, people will be running up the platform with the train, why? You do know it will stop and there will be enough time for you to get on? Perhaps you don't get a seat (no Maria Bünzli, your ticket gets you on the train, it doesn't secure you a seat), but you're on it. Also, do some p..."

Centered around the discussion of JRPGs. Members • Terry309 中文 (繁體)Tiếng Việt Why do so many female characters flail their arms around like a penguin when they run? Question It seems to be a common trope for female characters in games to flap their arms back and forth whenever they run around, particularly in fully 3d games with camera controls. It's so common to see this penguin running in so many JRPG's and it's only the female characters that do this. Why? People don't run like that LMAO, it looks so stupid and unnatural.

It is difficult to overstate his influence. He designed the FGC-9, one of the most popular 3D-printed guns in circulation. He also created Deterrence Dispensed, an influential network of gun designers. Since his death in 2021 he has been revered as a quasi-martyr for the right to bear arms, resulting in a cult-like following within the 3D-printed gun movement.Using a combination of open-source material, I traced JStark1809’s digital footprint, identified him as Jacob Duygu, and found p..."

I visited my doctor because I hurt my knee aftering doing a squat with bad form and he was telling me how it's the dumbest excersize \"in the world\" because it destroys your knees. Is this true? I'm skeptical myself but I know some of you guys are very knowledgeable.

Posted on April 12, 2023April 12, 2023 by ahorschig When assessing and fixing the cause of knee pain, there is one factor that many completely miss. The motion of tibial rotation. Let me explain. You see, as you descend into a squat your knee moves towards and (in some people) eventually over the toes. This motion comes from the ankle joint (called dorsiflexion). Restrictions in ankle mobility halt forward knee travel and limit squat depth. Doing so in many cases causes the knee joint to take on more load more quickly, increasing risk of injury. While improving ankle dorsiflexion is a helpful solution for increasing..."

Question for you men who date women: Say you go on a first date and the chemistry is great, conversation flows, you talk about the possibility of a second date. Is it a turn off to you if the woman is first to reach out after the date? Or only if you're not interested? I have a friend who's very independent but thinks the woman should never be the first to text after a first date. I personally like to say thank you and express that I had a good time, and don't feel the need to wait. What do you think? Can a woman ruin her chances with you if she..."

Here I was examined, had a mammogram, and went to ultrasound. Ultrasound sent me back to mammogram as they wanted some closer images of micro calcifications they had seen. I then had my ultrasound.

I was very upset (as thought it was just going to be a cyst) and was saying I’m too young to have cancer etc etc and the nurses comforted me and just said I know it’s rubbish. They didn’t once suggest it could be anything else. They did a biopsy and gave me my appointment for results at the same time (t..."

Medical Advice Hi there, my 7 month old almost always has his mouth open, I think it’s habit as he seems to be breathing through his nose. However I need to get a passport for him to be able to visit my family and a requirement for the photos is that his mouth is closed - I’ve already had a photo rejected due to this. I need to get photos re-done, but would love to know if anyone has any tricks to get baby to close their mouth. I have tried pressing his jaw shut with my fingers, but he resists most of the time or just immediately opens it again. I was thinking of trying to give him a tiny bit o..."

Members • lonesomedreams_ 8.5 month old inspects toys closely and it’s freaking me out Skills and Milestones Hi there. Looking for some honest insight. My 8.5 month old does have a medical history which is why I’m extra anxious about everything, so I’m trying to figure out if this is normal. If I give him an item, he seems so curious about it and will hold it a few inches from his face and rotate it and then mouth it, or will just play by moving it around and “inspecting” it. He just seems so curious and it’s very cute but then I googled it…. When we are reading books he likes to try to look at the back of the book, and then flip it around a few times. It..."
