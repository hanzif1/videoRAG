It makes me feel better to know others are aging too. Judge me if you like. “Don’t feel too bad, Dwight,” I said with faux sympathy. “It happens to all of us in the end.” Dwight laughed. “Oh no,” he said, “these are clear lenses. I just do more business when I’m wearing them.” Dwight sells cars for a living. I was confused.

I knew Ryan Coogler and Michael B and that’s all I needed to know. So happy because absolutely nothing -not even the premise- was spoiled, which made the film so much more of an enjoyable surprise of a ride! But I need to talk about that ONE scene in the juke joint.

I remember writing about the Rococo style and the rise of the French aristocracy in the 18th century. I also remember discussing how this scene represents a young woman who is being pushed on a swing by an older man (shown in the background on the right). This older suitor or husband seems unaware, however, that a younger suitor is hiding in the bushes (on the left). To put it mildly, this younger suitor is getting a very privileged viewpoint of his beloved on the swing: he can look up her dress!1 She, in turn, kicks off her shoe (a symbol of sexuality) in the direction of the young suitor.

Previous episodes have already joked that Bluey and Mackenzie will get married, so the kid’s appearance is a reference to that. More importantly: Bluey was the one playing with the laser toy during the episode. Although if this was real life either Bluey or Bingo’s kid could have a similar toy, the episode is trying to establish a parallel, and it makes more sense according to the conventions of storytelling if Bluey’s kid is the one with the similar toy.

Discussion August 2025 edit: No I didn’t ever find a fix, I just got used to it unfortunately. Skip the iPhone 15. Edit: if you haven’t gotten the 15 Pro yourself then there’s no point giving your opinion on a phone you haven’t actually tried out. The overall issue isn’t how I turn out in the photo, it’s how the entire photo turns out. It leaves the entire photo with a grey wash under many different lightings, over contrasted and increasing shadowing/definition in the wrong areas. Increasing texture and fine line on the skin doesn’t immediately mean it’s more realistic. ..."

Most of my missionaries who came here to school after their missions have now gone on in their career. However there are two younger siblings of two of my missionaries here today. Odbayar Badamjav and Arti Vandhana Nair. And for a moment, I'd like to show a slide if I might.

Some last an appropriate amount of time and some last longer than they should. Many children will cease to use oral habits that are no longer appropriate by themselves and others will need help from their parents. Today’s discussion will focus on the most common oral habits seen in young children and their possible effects (positive and negative).Common oral habits in children consist of mouth breathing, pacifier use and thumb sucking.  As a speech-language pathologist I have seen children with a wide variety of these oral habits.

Maybe you wonder what to do or who to see about this. Is it normal if my baby always sleeps with her mouth open? When babies sleep, physiologically, their mouth should be closed, and the tongue should be up in the palate area. Therefore, sleeping with the mouth open is not what we should see on a regular basis, although there are exceptions. Sometimes, babies can indeed sleep with their mouths open, and if this is only occasionally, it’s generally not a cause of concern. Babies..."

Welcome! Members Online • Feisty_Ferret_6277 Baby grabbing spoon incorrectly- what to do? 6 months old Just started 6 mo on solids. I'm having trouble getting food in her mouth. When I'm bringing the spoon towards her mouth, she grabs it with both hands right where the food is sitting. So all the food ends up on her hands, not in her mouth. Looks like she wants to feed herself. I'm happy to give her preloaded spoons, but she keeps grabbing the part of the spoon where the food sits, not the handle. Any tips on how to get her to hold the handle, or at least stop grabbing the food and let me feed her? Read more Share New to Reddit? Create your account and..."

So the concept of Baby Led Weaning was always far from my mind… Until Veronika got her hands on a spoon! From the moment I spooned up her first puree, this girl wanted control. She had no interest in being spoon-fed, but she was delighted when she was in charge. As a result, I quickly looked into Baby Led Weaning. In the ensuing few weeks, I learned some tricks of the trade. Here are just a few to impart: Always use unbreakable utensils, sized just right for a baby. I love the curve of Munchkin spoons, which also turn white if food is too hot. Veronika’s spoon inevitably is on the ground by the end of every meal, and same goes for bowls, and..."

The player guides the snake around the grid in search of apples, and each time the snake comes in contact with an apple, its body grows one unit in length. However, if the snake collides with its own body or the boundary of the grid, the game ends. As the snake grows, it becomes more difficult to maneuver around its own body and eat apples.

Google says our baby will start crawling between 7 and 10 months, but if he’s already rolled in both directions at 3 months (Google says 5 to 7 months for rolling), I highly doubt it’s gonna take him five months to figure out crawling.

Around four to seven months is when most babies begin to roll over, though a few may start as early as three months. The milestone usually progresses first with a tummy-to-back roll, with the back-to-tummy move coming a few weeks later.

The tech said she thinks it might be a girl because if it was a boy she should have seen some boy parts. Baby did move alot tho so im thinking maybe it could be a girl? Not that it really matters as long as the baby is healthy, but im really curious what are the chances of it really being a girl. Have any of you had a similar experience? What did it turn out to be?

The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded, like a ball, and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket.In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate).DDH may affect 1 or both hips, but it's more common in the left hip.
