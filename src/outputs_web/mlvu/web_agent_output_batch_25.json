They’re prime real estate for creativity, giving you space to display a great number of things that can reflect your style and personality. So, instead of just lining up rows of books, think about how other objects can add contrast, texture, and interest. Here are some fresh ideas to make your bookshelves more than just just rows of spines. Sculptural Art Adding sculptures or small statues brings an artistic touch that books alone can’t achieve.

The coach will dump in two pucks, and teams must score on their assigned net. The goal is for the team to score both pucks, or just one, if the other team scores as well. You can keep score for each line they are in and come up with a fun \"punishment\" for the losing team. What I like so much about this drill is that it forces creativity and thinking since two pucks are in play, but it also forces the forwards to play defense and the defense to play forward, breaking players out of any boxes they may have. You can also time limit each shift to stop players from trying to gain possession and waste time stick handling and defenders not pressuring in order to avoid forcing a play. When you tell them they only have 30 seconds to score two goals, they get to work pretty quickly. Top picks Small ..."

One of the sad things about the modern game (apart from the oft-cited and obvious) is that all goals are becoming standardised, much like the new grounds, programmes and coffee. You take a look in any of the numerous new stadia built recently and they all have exactly the same goals – back stanchion posts tied to the top corner. Is this a new FIFA ruling? It all began around the mid-eighties and the Mexico 86 World Cup. One thing that disturbed me about Mexico was the size of the goals. Obviously the frontage was the standard issue 24’ by 8’, but the size of the nets behind was cause for grave concern. The style of goal they used was rarely seen in England at that time, but very ..."
