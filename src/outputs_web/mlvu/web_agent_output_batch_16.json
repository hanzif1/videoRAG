You notice that each animal has something colorful hanging from one or both ears. Wait a minute. Do cows wear earrings? Yes—sort of. Cattle and other livestock including goats and sheep commonly wear ear tags. These colorful plastic tags are used as a way to identify each animal. Tag color, location in left or right ear, numbers, and letters work like a code. Based on the code, the farmer can quickly tell important information about an animal, such as: Year of birth Individual identification number or name Sex (bull or heifer) Place of birth Farmers develop a tag system that works best for their farm. Cracking the EAR TAG Code As you can tell from her tag, “Ruby” is the name of this beef calf. On this farm, purple or pink ID tags are use..."

Posted on September 11, 2010 by wagfarms I had a question asked of me on Twitter today, or should I say I answered one that was being discussed. Someone was wondering how we decide what tags go on which cows. I had never thought of it before. Sometimes, when you’re on the inside, things seem so obvious that you forget that others don’t know why you’re doing it…it’s an epidemic in agriculture, and one we’re working on fixing.

The white tags mean that the calf is a bull, the yellow tag means that it’s a heifer (a female that hasn’t had a calf yet). Se..."

Initially, Thor’s hammer was thought of as made of stone, but in the Eddaic tradition it is an iron weapon forged by Svartálfar (black elves, correlated with the dvergar, dwarves) named Sindri and Brokkr. In the Norse myths Thor’s hammer is often understood as an axe, which, being thrown, comes back like a boomerang. It is also capable of becoming so small as to be carried under the clothes. Mjöllnir is Thor’s characteristic weapon, like Gungnir, Odin’s magical spear, or Týr’s sword. Thor’s hammer is feared by jötnar, giants of Norse mythology (singular jötunn) who endeavor to steal it or decoy the god of thunder into their lands without his hammer and Megingjörð, Thor’s belt of power. Miniature pendant replicas of Thor’s hammer were very p..."
