So I was watching some YouTube videos on fridge organization and I found myself thinking like wtf is this. Most of them only have like drinks, sodas, juices, milk - especially almond milk it seems - eggs, and select vegetables and fruits - particularly with bright colours! - and not much more.

My chair from the stick chair class has been languishing in my workshop. The class was frantic. There are a lot of little bits of tear out I want to fix up along with little glue splashes.

The locals being traditional farmers found that it was very useful for marking sheep. This deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. The Italian's were first to apply the wooden holders to the graphite rods. Although flat and oval shaped, their first use was carpentry. The eraser was then added in 1858 by Hymen Lipman who patented the idea. Creating different hardness' ..."

If you haven't checked it out, please do--the photos are stunning, intimate and truly do the 100 year old factory justice.

The first to construct pencils for New England trade was a young Concordian named David Hubbard, but according to Actonian Horace Hosmer, the pencils “were of little value, and but few of them were manufactured.” In 1812, another Concordian, David Munroe, created a better product by mixing the lead, or plumbago, with an adhesive substance, and spreading the soft paste into grooves cut into a cedar casing, leaving them to dry..."

As luck would have it, I had just received some beautiful linen coasters edged in tatted lace. They were a surprise gift from my tea friend Nancy in Puerto Rico. And I must say I love the elegant touch it gives to add one of these to the teacup and saucer. There were six of the lace coasters in the set, and now I'm fairly sure I know what I'm going to do with them!

However, I’ve found that rarely does life cooperate with ideals. I live in an 1,100 square foot apartment on the 20th floor of a high rise. I don’t have a basement, but I make do with an array of closets, cabinets and other out-of-the-way corners. As you scope out where the best nooks your home has to offer for canned good store, here are a few things to keep in mind. –You want to keep your canned goods out of the sunlight. Over time, natural light can deteriorate your product, stealing color and quality. –Cooler is better. I’m not talking freezing temps, but definitely don’t store home ca..."

But finally, thanks to four wide narrow drawers in my current house that inspired me to store my spice jars lying down in a drawer instead of vertically on shelves or racks, I think I have found the best way to organize spice jars.
