Seguin has been asked to expand our conservation role by Maine Department of Marine Resources to serve as a real time VHF relay station for the listening buoys that have been placed in the Gulf of Maine.

January 15, 2017 Dear Guests: Welcome back to another end of season edition of the annual Bunny Clark Guestletter. We had great expectations for the 2016 fishing season. We had already put 1000 hours on the new engine, installed before the beginning of the 2015 season, with few problems. I was also excited by the warmer than normal winter we had previous to this upcoming season. Normally, this heralds earlier than normal haddock schools, earlier pollock fishing and larger than normal individuals of each species. And our fishing regulations were going to be much more conducive to attracting anglers. I was very upbeat about moving forward.

They came in by early August and kept coming in. A friend reported that the oama fishers have thinned but the oama are biting really well in the evening with papio hitting the piles. Halalu came in thick in some spots and bit like crazy. They were so close in a few not-so-secret places, that a straight pole with bait was enough to fill a bucket. That appears to have peaked, but they are still around. The bigger 5 to 8lb papio were seen and caught early in the season, and now the the 1 to 3 lb papio are hitting t..."

I’m not sure how he ended up north but the next thing I knew, we were lining up ice fishing seminars, with Dave Genz being the main speaker. He brought along his invention, a portable “flip-over” style fishing shelter called the “Fish Trap.” Sporting a plywood floor and white canvas, Genz manufactured them out of his home. We were wowed, as we had never seen anything like it. This, I believe, was the spring-board for the ice fishing industry, as everything else slowly but surely followed suit. Dave even taught us to use our Coleman lanterns for heat, which worked fine, especially when we stayed after dark. Coleman’s “Focus 5” came next and was quite a heater. Everybody had one.
