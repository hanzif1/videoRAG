My money is on the decoder-free, joint embedding approach. Like many others, Eric Xing and his team are proponent of the decoder-based ..."

I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch.

Learn about different YOLO algorithm versions and start training your own YOLO object detection models.Rohit KunduGuest AuthorObject detection is a popular task in computer vision. It deals with localizing a region of interest within an image and classifying this region like a typical image classifier. One image can include several regions of interest pointing to different objects. This makes object detection a more advanced problem of image classification.YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It was first introduced by Joseph Redmon et al. in 2016 and has since undergone several iterations, the latest being YOLO v7.In this article, we will discuss wha..."

Illustration Maria G WestIt’s important not to oversimplify the complex interconnectedness between men, women and jewellery. Although we traditionally see the sphere as the domain of women, it has historically been men in positions of power as business owners, celebrated designers and consumers. For centuries, women were the recipients of jewellery as gifts, tokens and expressions of love, but perhaps not the ones setting the rules or controlling the purse strings.

Jewellery made from shells, stone and bones survives from prehistoric times. It is likely that from an early date it was worn as a protection from the dangers of life or as a mark of status or rank. In the ancient world the discovery of how to work metals was an important stage in the development of the art of jewellery. Over time, metalworking techniques became more sophisticated and decoration more intricate. Gold, a rare and highly valued material, was buried with the dead so as to accompany its owner into the afterlife. Much archaeological jewellery comes from tombs and hoards. Sometimes, as with the gold collars from Ce..."

It was an incredible experience, three weeks of seminars with film music agents, music contractors, and composers. (James Newton Howard gave a two hour Q&A, and I was sitting right next to him, freaking out the entire time). At the end of the three week session a hat was passed around the room, and each of the ten student composers pulled a piece of paper from it. On each piece of paper was the name of a different movie, all movies that were in theaters at that time. (I remember someone getting Will Smith’s Wild Wild West). I got the Glenn Close live..."

Jonathan Smuts 27 January, 2022 People often ask me, “How do I go from playing my piece slowly to being able to play it fast?” So today we’re going to be talking about how YOU can learn to play faster! The first thing you need to know is that learning to play fast is not a separate thing all on its own. It’s actually a symptom of other things behind the scenes that are working well. Let me tell you a little story about what this looked like for me when I first started learning to play the harp. I had a really amazing teacher, but there were a few little gaps in what I learned. When I would learn to play a piece, I couldn’t understand why I..."

It was an incredible experience, three weeks of seminars with film music agents, music contractors, and composers. (James Newton Howard gave a two hour Q&A, and I was sitting right next to him, freaking out the entire time). At the end of the three week session a hat was passed around the room, and each of the ten student composers pulled a piece of paper from it. On each piece of paper was the name of a different movie, all movies that were in theaters at that time. (I remember someone getting Will Smith’s Wild Wild West). I got the Glenn Close live..."

Colliders Collider components define the shape of an object for the purposes of physical collisions. A collider, which is invisible, need not be the exact same shape as the object’s mesh and in fact, a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. The simplest (and least processor-intensive) colliders are the so-called primitive collider types. In 3D, these are the Box Collider, Sphere Collider and Capsule Collider. In 2D, you can use the Box Collider 2D and Circle Collider 2D. Any number of these can be added to a single object to create compound colliders. With careful positioning and sizing, compound colliders can often approximate the sha..."

Learn about different YOLO algorithm versions and start training your own YOLO object detection models.Rohit KunduGuest AuthorObject detection is a popular task in computer vision. It deals with localizing a region of interest within an image and classifying this region like a typical image classifier. One image can include several regions of interest pointing to different objects. This makes object detection a more advanced problem of image classification.YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It was first introduced by Joseph Redmon et al. in 2016 and has since undergone several iterations, the latest being YOLO v7.In this article, we will discuss wha..."
