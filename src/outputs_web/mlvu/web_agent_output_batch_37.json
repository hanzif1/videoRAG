In fact, I’m still catching up from last October’s recipe wish-list. When I had seen a recipe for caramelized orange-pumpkin flan in last year’s October issue of Sunset, I thought I had a winner and put the recipe aside to try. Reading through the recipe, I turned my nose up at some the the ingredients and came up with my own version of a pumpkin-orange flan. As much as I enjoy using pumpkin in recipes, my interest peaks during the fall, so I try to limit using pumpkin in my cooking and baking to October and November. On..."

Much like Mac users and Windows users. Sure, the basics are all the same.

She’s paralyzed neck down. She can’t speak properly either due to the fact that she’s on a trachea collar. Any devices out there that maybe can automatically answer the phone call on her end.

Without providing lab safety equipment you run a high risk of horrible accidents. Here is a list of lab safety equipment and why you need them. They are essential safety equipment for your laboratory. Laboratories are dangerous places by nature. There are devices like Bunsen burners with gas-operated open flames, there are corrosive acids and bases, there is spring-loaded equipment that can hit people, there are sharp apparatus that is easy to cut your hand on and get infected ‒ the list can go on and on. Since all of these (and more) make a laboratory a risky place, your best bet is to invest in lab safety equipment early on. While procuring lab equipment, you should add the followin..."

Both eggs are identical. The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again. However, once an egg is broken, that’s it for that egg. If an egg breaks when dropped from a floor, then it would also have broken from any floor above that. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that.

My favorite one is also known as one of the favorites among Google recruiters: You work in a 100 floor building and you get 2 identical eggs. You need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking. Find an algorithm that is minimizing number of throws in the worst-case scenario. We can make a few assumptions: If an egg doesn’t break when dropped from some floor, then it will not break when dropped from any lower floors. An egg that survives a fall can be used again. A broken egg must be discarded. The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs. If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor. Most people writes some algo..."
