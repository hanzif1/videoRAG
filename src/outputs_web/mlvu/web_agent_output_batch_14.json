Without Elena to help entertain them, I could hardly do them all justice. I saw Stephen at, I think, his best.

This hike started as a wild idea when I saw the making of Dune, which was, among other popular movies like Star Wars and the Martian, shot in this desert. The red sand, flat valleys and mountains that abruptly arise from the sand make this area look like Mars. So I started planning this desert hike, which was hard, since I've only found one other person who recorded a multi-day hike in this desert. There is no water in the desert, and apart from the tourist Bedouin camps, there isn't much out there at all. It would be a challenging hike, but also one of the most cinematic and unique ones I have done. And those are exactly the things I am looking for in a hike. Wadi Rum stands for valley / dry riverbed of (fine) sand, and is called Valley of the Moon by locals. It..."

A team of Purdue University researchers in the White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) and College of Engineering investigated whether Americans were willing to put on their walking shoes to take in the sights and sounds at an urban tourist destination. Instead of traveling by a car, a rideshare service or even a Bird scooter, walking on your vacation can keep your step count intact. The Centers for Disease Control and Pr..."
