One of them was short and looked rather elderly; the other was enormous and bald, about forty-five and as swarthy as pitch. The plain clothes they wore hung awkwardly on them, and when they spoke they raised their hands as if in salute. While I was saying good-by to my friends and the family, the police, with excessive politeness, hid behind the doors. The older man, when he left, kept taking off his hat and saying, “Excusez, Madame!” One of the two detectives who had been pursuing me so tirelessly and vehemently during the past two months was waiting outside the door.

Figure 2: The transfer of a small amount of solid. Figure 3: Using a piece of weighing paper to transfer a solid. It is usually easier to transfer solids to a wide mouthed container such as a beaker.

Many solid chemicals can be easily transferred by tipping the bottle and slowly rotating the bottle back and forth. Don't tip the bottle up high and let the contents pour out. If a spatula is provided at the reagent bottle, you may use it. Never use your own spatula. Be sure to put the right lid on the right bottle and return the bottle to its place on the shelf.

(May 22, 2010) Surrey, British Columbia I like to tell people that I’m biking to Newfoundland. The common response is something like, “What? Why would you want to ride your bike there?” and I’m like “Why wouldn’t I want to?” I guess part of the reason I want to ride to Newfoundland is because I’ll have to cross the rest of the country to get there, making sure that I don’t shortcut my way out of experiencing a whole bunch of marvellous and fantastic things along the way.

Does anyone know? I watch a lot of Hell's Kitchen, so my (very limited) understanding is that the executive chef oversees the kitchen and creates the menus. But what about during actual service? Are they always the expediter like in the show, or do actual restaurants function differently?
