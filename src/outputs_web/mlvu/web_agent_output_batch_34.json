TED is the copyright owner of this talk and the original video is featured above. Speech Transcript I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call “the danger of the single story.” I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.

I have been very cooperative with the teachers and administration. I have been coming up with suggestions to make the situation better but most are a completely flop apparently. I have the impression that they want to categorize him in the special need ( which I am not against him getting helped if he does need it).
