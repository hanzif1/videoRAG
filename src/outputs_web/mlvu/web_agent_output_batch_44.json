These motions are often created by animators or generated using motion capture data. To coordinate multiple characters, the engine plans their actions based on a centralized or ..."

No, not like that, you pervert and also me after I wrote that sentence. Idle animations. I’m talking about idle animations. The above video contains some great ones, although I wish there were more modern games in it. Then again, I feel like first-person games and more action-oriented, cross-the-line-and-enemies-emerge-from-every-conceivable-corner shooters have cut down on the need for them.

I’m Tim Schuchert, a narrative design colleague of Edwin’s, and the topic I want to analyze here is one that came up in a discussion in the formidable Narrative House Discord server, that you should join, if you haven’t already. There the question was asked, why so many game protagonists feel like they are underdeveloped as characters and act as if they are just assholes with special powers. The Game Protagonist Let me start by first explaining what a game’s protagonist even is. And this question is a very intriguing one to start with, because the answer to it has many facets. To do so we need a bit of term declaration first. When we create a game, we want to shape an experience for the player that is created when they play our game. The narrative, just like the mechanics, visuals, or sound of a game, is a tool to be u..."

We wanted the player to think “I am” instead of “Daniel is” and in that way make it a very personal experience. The main motivation for this was of course to make the game scary, but also for the memories that were revealed to feel more personal for the player. In this post I will go through some of the design thinking we used, problems it caused and how..."

SubscribeSign inWhy is a silent protagonist often the best choice for a game?I used to hate silent protagonists in games. However, I've changed my mind.Adam MirkowskiMar 17, 20241Share\"Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.\"As a fan of narrative-focused games, it was hard for me to accept a situation in which the hero I controlled didn't speak. However, I've changed my mind and now find it to be something unique for the medium of video games. I hope you will do the same after reading this, or at least understand the reasons behind such a decision.In the era of early video games, protagonists often didn't say a single word. Mario, Link, or Doomguy didn't speak. Technological limitations were the obvious reason, but those games were also more interested in finding fun in the gameplay than in telling stories.In cinematography, silent films became extinct over the years when technologic..."
