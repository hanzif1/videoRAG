Both eggs are identical. The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again. However, once an egg is broken, that’s it for that egg. If an egg breaks when dropped from a floor, then it would also have broken from any floor above that. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that. The question is: What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution..."

(20 min. for drop) Topics Forces and Motion Activity Type Exploration Language English Print In this exploration, students design, evaluate, test, and suggest improvements for a container that will protect their precious payload: an egg. The Classic \"Egg-Drop\" experiment has been a standard in science instruction for many years. Essentially, students are asked to construct some type of container that will keep a raw egg from cracking when dropped from ever-increasing elevations. There are three basic ways to increase the likelihood of safely dropping an egg: Slow down the descent speed.Parachutes are an obvious method for slowing the decent speed, as long as the design includes a way to keep the parachute open. Cushion the egg so that something other than the egg itself absorbs the impact of landing. The largest end of the egg has an area of air trapped between the egg's two membranes. This air space forms..."

Electromagnetic waves are a combination of electrical and magnetic fields that overlap. The radio converts these electromagnetic waves, called a signal, into sounds that humans can hear.

Pliers are long nosed pliers which I find easier to manipulate the wire with. Then came extra long nose pliers for the hard to reach places! Round nosed pliers, these have a finer nose and is sometimes easier for grabbing the wire. I also use them for creating wings. Off course you need something to measure with, it doesn't matter if it's a ruler or a tape! Last but by no means least, gloves to protect your hands. Over the years I've added tools but the ones I mention above were the tools I started my fairy making journey with. Plus tin snips when I was cutting wire from a roll of galvanised wire.

I used to think it was as simple as going into a store, looking around, grabbing a shirt and then leaving. I never gave a second thought to the workers that offered help. The only thing that ever concerned me when I walked into a store was whether or not I was going to find the pants or shirt I was looking for in my size. But that all changed the day I started working in clothing retail. So what’s the deal with clothing stores?

I rent a room on the second floor of the house. Most guests leave the room door closed when they are in the room and when they are out. But, now and then a guest will leave the door open while out (I’ve only had one who insisted on leaving the door open at night while he was sleeping…long story).

Your cat is weaving around your ankles, meowing and begging for food. You oblige by opening a can of his favorite: ocean whitefish pate, or filet mignon au jus, or whichever flavor he seems to prefer this week, and he does the strangest thing! He acts like the meal you just placed in his bowl (and maybe broke apart with a fork – one of yours from the silverware drawer), the one you took a special trip to the overpriced boutique pet shop for, because it’s his “favorite,” was something ..."

And with Jeff Burks on vacation, the content has been a little light here. So here is the draft miniature chapter I wrote on the airplane on using nails. I’m often asked why I prefer nails to screws.
