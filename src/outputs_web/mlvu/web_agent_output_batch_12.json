                "detail": "While exploring the Atlantic seafloor, scientists made a surprising discovery: a bright yellow deep-sea sponge sitting side by side with a vibrant pink starfish, more than a mile beneath the surface 🌊 Using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), the team spotted this unusual duo at Retrieval Seamount, around 1,885 meters deep, east of New England. The sponge, belonging to the genus Hertwigia, stood out with its rare neon yellow color, a striking contrast in the deep-sea world where whites and oranges usually dominate. The starfish, from the genus Chondraster, sports five arms covered in suction-tube feet and it’s no innocent companion. This little predator feeds on sponges and other small marine invertebrates. Though the image instantly reminded people of SpongeBob and Patrick, this likely wasn’t a friendly hangout… more like “SpongeBob meets his predator” 🧽🍴 📸 Captured by NOAA’s Okeanos Explorer team, this photo offers a rare glimpse into the deep ocean’s alien-like beauty and a real-life..."

Author Heather Manitzas Hill \tOther Posts By Heather Manitzas Hill August 10, 2021 | 1 Comment What’s SpongeBob Squarepants’ claim to fame besides being an animated cheese-looking, blockhead sponge under-the-sea main character of a children’s cartoon with catchy song lyrics? Apparently, aside from the possible influence on decreased attention span in children, the creators of SpongeBob SquarePants weren’t too far off in their character portrayal of different sea creatures, including the many different invertebrates, including a sea sponge, sea star, octopus, and crab.

I’ve been an avid fan of animation from literally before I could talk. I have watched thousands upon thousands of hours of animation in my lifetime. Nimbus Libéré (“Nimbus Released”) is the worst cartoon I’ve ever seen and it’s not even close.  If Foodfight! was a perfect 0, Nimbus Libéré is a minus googol. In every technical area, animation, sound, writing, it’s abysmal. In style, it is repellent. In intent, it is pure evil.

If I manage to do that more than once a year, I feel even better about myself. I’ve been deeply in love with these films since I first discovered them so many years ago – and every time someone asks me what’s my favorite movie (a question that a film critic hears quite often), I never hesitate before answering “The Godfather – all nine hours of it”.

They observe how neurons fire as a person reads certain words, for example, or plays a video game.

Increasingly, researchers are bringing that reality into how they study brains.Collective neuroscience, as some practitioners call it, is a rapidly growing field of research. An early, consistent finding is that when people converse or share an experience, their brain waves synchronize. Neurons in corresponding locations of the different brains fire at the same time, creating matching patterns, like dancers moving tog..."

Although those are valid OCD compulsions, such perceptions fail to acknowledge the  distressing thoughts that occur prior to such behaviours and also fails to highlight the utter devastation that constant compulsions (no matter what they are) can cause. Although there are infinite forms of OCD, it has been traditionally considered that a person’s OCD will fall into one of these five main categories, with themes often overlapping between categories too.

Shen Northeast Transportation Policy Analyst/Advocate At some point as a bright-eyed kid who loved STEM, I was told to “draw an engineer”. You can probably guess what happened. My little stick figure came with a hard hat, a wrench, and no indication of them being a woman. This matches over 50 years of research showing children drawing only 27% of scientists as female, with similar trends for drawing engineers. And when children don’t imagine women as engineers and scientists, that directly shapes the future. This already shows up with severe underrepresentation of women in civil engineering (16%) and the transportation industry as a whole (14.5%). And this is just the tip of the iceberg of the many ways se..."
