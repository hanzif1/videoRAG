I searched for the average peel to fruit ratio but found nothing credible. I did have this juicy and delicious mineola on hand, however. Holy cow! The peel accounted for fifty-three grams—23 percent—of this orange. Let’s assume the average peel weighs even less. Even a 15 to 85 peel to fruit ratio translates to hundreds of millions of pounds of peels in the trash every year. When those peels break down in landfill, they release methane gas, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. (Compost those same peels and they actually sequester carbon.) But now for the good news! These peels have many uses. ..."

Cara cara, navel, valencia, blood — they’re all perfect for snacking, dressing up a salad, and making orange juice. But after you’ve enjoyed the fruit, don’t toss the peel! Indeed, the orange peels (also called orange rinds) have just as many uses (if not more) as the fruit inside. From brightening up dishes to infusing drinks, the orange peel is a versatile, dynamic ingredient that deserves its own time in the spotlight. How to use orange peels in food and drinksOrange peels are divided into two parts: the zest and the pith. The zest is the brightly colored outermost layer of the peel, and the pith is the white, spongy layer right below that. Unlike lemons, whose pith tends to be extremely bitter, oranges have a more milder, sometimes even slightly sweet pith, which means you can..."
