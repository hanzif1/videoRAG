So how about an hybrid between the two? Here is my instructable on how to make one-time-use washable handkerchiefs and the box that goes with it!Step 1: Materials You will need: - one regular tissue paper box and extra cardboard (or another tissue paper box) - at least one tissue paper for the size - fabric to make washable handkerchiefs - glue - Podge - paintbrush to apply the glue and the podge - fabric scissors - regular scissors and/or exacto - tread and needle (or sewing machine) - 2 ..."

At the time, I thought that it was an old campy Mexican TV show. Further research on the internet showed that it was a B-movie of the Argentinian variety*. We had purchased 4 photographs, got them framed and wanted to hang them on a wall. In the past, I've done all sorts of division, taping and remeasuring work out how exactly to hang sets of pictures.

Clarkeasy interior decorating ideasHome About Me Our Home Shop My Style Contact Can You Have Too Many Gallery Walls? June 12, 2014 Someone commented on one of my many gallery wall pins a few weeks ago, and asked if you can have too many gallery walls in your house: I may be the wrong girl to ask since I’ve never met a gallery wall I didn’t like.
