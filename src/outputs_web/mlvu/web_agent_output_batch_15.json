Gabriel Alves, Arron Kau, Geoff Pilling, and 5 others James Innes Refath Bari Nguyen Quang Josh Silverman Jimin Khim contributed Egg dropping refers to a class of problems in which it is important to find the correct response without exceeding a (low) number of certain failure states. In a toy example, there is a tower of \\(n\\) floors, and an egg dropper with \\(m\\) ideal eggs. The physical properties of the ideal egg is such that it will shatter if it is dropped from floor \\(n^*\\) or above, and will have no damage whatsoever if it is dropped from floor \\(n^*-1\\) or below. The problem is to find a strategy such that the egg droppe..."

[3]In thermodynamics, you can’t unscramble an egg or a \"broken egg can't unite back into a whole egg\" are oft-used layperson’s descriptions of the either entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, or the arrow of time. An common logic to this teaching method is that it is said that a fresh new egg is in a \"low entropy state\" or ordered state and that a cracked or scrambled egg is in a \"high entropy state\" or disordered state. Then it is said that the second law mandates that systems tend to increase in their entropy, or systems tend towards maximal entropy, or something to this effect.History In 1954, English thermodynamicist Alfred Ubbelohde was discussing entropy and irreversibility as embodiment in the examples of Humpty Dumpty, broken eggs, spilt..."

Search Main menu Home Ag Book of the Day Baking Cooking OTC diagnosis About Contact Val Post navigation ← Previous Next → And the tag means??? Posted on September 11, 2010 by wagfarms I had a question asked of me on Twitter today, or should I say I answered one that was being discussed. Someone was wondering how we decide what tags go on which cows. I had never thought of it before. Sometimes, when you’re on the inside, things seem so obvious that you forget that others don’t know why you’re doing it…it’s an epidemic in agriculture, and one we’re working on fixing. To answer the question, yes the tag does mean something. When calves are first born (or at least soon after), they get a tag in their ear with the same number their cow has.

You notice that each animal has something colorful hanging from one or both ears. Wait a minute. Do cows wear earrings? Yes—sort of. Cattle and other livestock including goats and sheep commonly wear ear tags. These colorful plastic tags are used as a way to identify each animal. Tag color, location in left or right ear, numbers, and letters work like a code. Based on the code, the farmer can quickly tell important information about an animal, such as: Year of birth Individual identification number or name Sex (bull or heifer) Place of birth Farmers develop a tag system that works best for their farm.
