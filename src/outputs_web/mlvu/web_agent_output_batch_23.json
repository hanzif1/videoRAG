On May 9, 1754, the Pennsylvania Gazette printed Benjamin Franklin’s political cartoon, Join, or Die. The image is believed to be one of the first political cartoon ever depicted in an American newspaper. The original intention of the cartoon actually came years before the American Revolutionary War. First used during the French and Indian War, the cartoon was meant to unite colonists against French involvement in North America. A decade later in 1765, colonists used the cartoon to protest unfair taxation. The cartoon was used again during the 1770's to help change the hearts and minds of the colonists towards an independent America. | Independence NHP, Edgar Allan Poe NHS & Thaddeus Kosciuszko NM"

I am putting some of my words first and keeping them short, and placing the poem below, as it is wildly long. A shade over 10,000 words. I love this poem. It is one of my favorite poems ever written. I don’t think it will fit in the entirety of this email, but I’ve tried to make it happen. I assume Substack will cut it off. Alas. If that happens, here is a link to it. But this poem. It is at once absurd and compassionate, wild and attentive, full of love and awareness. It is a poem composed entirely of questions (like Padgett Powell’s playful, wonderful novel The Interrogative Mood).

I’m the type of person who packs an umbrella even at the slightest possibility of rain – in fact, at school my friends found it amusing how I always seemed to have an umbrella even in the middle of summer. Lately though, I’d begun relying on a new weather app that provided very reliable hour-by-hour rain predictions to figure out what to wear in the morning – a sort of just-in-time clothing process – and today it told me the probability of rain was very low, hence no umbrella. And so here I was, sheltering underneath an awning waiting for the pedestrian lights to turn green, speaking to a guy who’d just been standing there. I hadn’t noticed him at first; I was listening to a podcast of This American Life, the one about Father’s Day, and it took a whil..."

He’ll be right back. I can hear the sound of that gray door—the steps there lead down into the fragrant connecting woodshed—as the lift-latch clicks shut. E. B.
