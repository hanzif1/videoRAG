I thinking these old Warner Brothers cartoons probably date from the 40s or 50s. In the cartoon with mice, I always see them come out of holes at the bottom of the walls. I’ve never seen a mousehold like that. Has anyone ever seen or lived in a house with a mousehole like that? Why do they portray mouseholes like that? And nowadays, if a house has a mouse, where do they live? evilbeth April 8, 2001, 8:11am 2 Well, I have never seen a mousehole perfectly shaped like those in cartoons but I have seen one along the bottom of a wall like those. It was just a little chewed-out roundish hole, not “door-shaped” like the cartoon ones. In houses now, mice live in walls very often. Our neighbors had a mouse in..."

And once inside they usually have a tiny suite of rooms with a little bed, a tiny sofa, etc. I always assumed the second part was pure make-believe, but do these little arch shaped doors really exist? If so, how did they get there? I can see that if such an opening in the wall really did exist, that a mouse would use it as handy little escape route and furthermore, any mouse living inside the walls might venture out such an opening to find some food…which explains why people are always putting mouse traps outside those little arched doors.

There wasn’t another one like it, she thought, running her eyes over the other coats hanging from the metal rack or delicately draped over a brocade sofa.
