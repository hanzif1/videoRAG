Invasion of the Coffee Mugs March 4, 2012 tags: collectibles, life, Margo Karolyi, personal essay on aging, the other side of 55 How many coffee mugs does the average person (or even the average family) need?  How many are in YOUR cupboard (go ahead – count them now, I’ll wait. Oh, and don’t forget the insulated ones you take with you in the car – count them too!) I’m going to suggest that the average person needs no more than three (okay, maybe four, depending on how often you run your dishwasher): one for right now (today), one in the sink/dishwasher (from yesterday), one in the cupboard (for tomorrow – or for company).  If you entertain a lot, then you might want to add one or two to your ‘acceptable’ limit, and if you’re the type who fills your own mug with coffee (or tea) at home rather than stopping at the local Tim’s or Starbucks or wherev..."

Bruce had led me in a trial involving the prosecution of a soldier who had mistreated a captured insurgent in Afghanistan. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand. This article briefly outlines the origin of silks presenting red bags to juniors at the bar. Justice Sackar QC, when being sworn into the Supreme Court of NSW in 2011, noted that the tradition of silk presenting red brief bags to junior counsel was not as widespread as it once was. In his address Justice Sackar referred to the occasion when he was presented with his red bag, as a junior, by Doug Staff QC. He said: I was rather overcome with the gesture until I..."

This lesson is for both electric and acoustic guitars - the main difference is the size of the body (acoustic guitars tend to be bulkier), but the holding position remains the same for both types. If there's one piece of advice I could give you, to remember every single time you pick up the guitar... don't hunch! So many guitarists get into the habit of hunching over their guitar.

When I play the chords like this I feel comfortable. However, when I play the Peter Gunn Theme Riff in order to reach the low e string with my fourth finger I have to bend my wrist a bit higher (which is normal, I guess?) It feels very uncomfortable to me though. Any advice? Blessings and thanks in advance! 2 Likes mattswain June 30, 2025, 10:32am 2 This is one of those questions where I needed to reach for my guitar to remember how I play it! The obvious difference between your position and mine, is that your elbow is into your side throughout, so there’s nowhere to go once your hand needs to move. When I play (and I’m no expert so others might disagree) there’s plenty of daylight between my elbow and the side of my body. There’s almost no adjustment neede..."

It is said to depict the Yellow House in the south of France. The Yellow House was known, to Vincent van Gogh, as the “studio of the south” where like-minded artists would congregate, although the idea never really came to fruition. Van Gogh painted this piece for his friend and fellow artist, Paul Gauguin, whom he wished to be a part of the “studio of the south.” The first things that drew my eye to the painting were the use of vivid color and line. Every object in the room is clearly and boldly outlined and then filled with almost child-like color. This technique struck me as different from the artist’s other works. If you were to compare “The Bedroom” to “Starry Night,” for example, you can see drastic differences. “The Bedroom” seems more manic, static, and elementary, while “Star..."

In these letters he often discussed his own artworks, and one such example regards Van Gogh’s 1888 oil painting The Bedroom, which he discusses in a letter to his brother Theo, shown below: Extract from Arles, 16 October 1888 \"My dear Theo, At last I can send you a little sketch […] This time it’s just simply my bedroom, only here colour is to do everything, and giving by its simplification a grander style to things, is to be suggestive here of rest or of sleep in general.

INTRODUCTION Although color is one of the more obvious and relatively easy to describe attributes of a historic bottle, it is unfortunately of limited utility in classifying a bottle as to age or type.  Probably the best discussions on this is from The Parks Canada Glass Glossary by Jones & Sullivan (1989), and is quoted below: \"Because colour is a universal attribute of glass and is convenient for mending and establishing minimal vessel counts, it has been latched onto by some archaeologists as a classification device. Although classification by colour is simple to do, the end result is of little value for the following reasons: colour does not have a direct ..."

I am new here and I am glad to be a part of the community. I was wondering if anyone can relate to this: I am always worried that I left some of the appliances on when I leave the house, or that I didn't lock the door. In fact, I know I did lock the door, and I always turn everything (oven, stove, iron...) off but I still have to come back and check! Usually, I have to come back multiple times, and even touch everything to make sure it is off. I always feel anxious that I might cause a fire or hurt somebody by not being cautious enough. If you can relate to this please let me know how do you cope with the problem. Thank you!Written byPurplerainsTo view profiles and participate in discussion..."

Inspired, he decided to change careers. After some independent practice and some time working at a small toy company, he secured a job at Hasbro. Two years later, he struck out on his own. He decided he wanted to invent a strategy game and was eventually struck with inspiration — he realized that most games are played on a horizontal plane and so he chose to go in a different direction (literally!) and create one on a vertical plane. In 1973, he used a series of transparent tubes and two sets of ping pong balls to develop Connect Four. It hit the market the f..."

February 21, 2024February 21, 2024 If the hood of your car unexpectedly pops open while you're driving, it can be a dangerous situation and should be handled with caution. Here's what may happen and what you should do: Limited Visibility: The hood obstructing your view can significantly reduce your visibility, making it difficult to see the road ahead and other vehicles around you. You can sometimes view through the gap under the hood and your car. Sudden wind resistance: The open hood creates significant wind resistance, which can affect your car's stability and control.

Here is our advice on how to use an extension cord correctly. Check before use Make sure that the extension cord is intact and free from damage before using it.
