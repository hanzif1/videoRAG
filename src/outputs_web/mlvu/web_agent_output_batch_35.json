Hi lads, I was wondering how many people made a pirate crew. If anyone could tell me how many sailors were usually on board of a sloop, schooner, brick and other ships, I would be really thankful ! I know that bigger ships were quite rare for pirates but I wish anyone could answer me about the same question concerning British ships, such as frigates, Men'O'War, etc...

Who Is Who - Pirate Ranks on Ship Roles and Positions on Pirate Ship - Meet the Pirate Crew! Captain People usually think that most pirate Captains commanded by an iron fist, but in most cases, it was not true. The pirate Captains were selected because they were respected, not feared. When selecting a Captain, the crew looked for someone capable of commanding and navigating a ship. Also, the Captain needed courage and skill in sword and pistol fighting. Captain had absolute control only in a battle. In everyday life, Captains did not have much more rights than any other crewmember. Even sail courses were determined by voting. In the Navy, captains and officers had military ranks. There was always a big gap between a common sailor and an officer. However, on a ship full of murderers, bandits, and thieves, most..."

But they all needed a crew, and each crew was a different size and made up of different people, but, begad, the ships were nearly always over-crowded and carrying the people below.CAPTAIN A pirate ship’s captain was usually picked and voted in by the crew. It’s also how most of them got replaced - the crew simply decided they didn’t want them to be captain any more and picked somebody else for the job. Sailors who were authoritative and daring always stood a better chance of getting picked.

It’s not all boarding ships, counting booty, and drinking rum like you might think. A great deal of hard work is required to run a sailing ship with a law-abiding crew, let alone one populated by pirates. In this essay we are going to examine the five principle officers on board a pirate ship, their duties, and their responsibilities. This is part one of a three part lesson. In the next lesson we will examine the duties and responsibilities of other officers and crew members with special duties. In the final lesson, we will look at one very special group of crew members that are almost always overlooked. Read on to learn what pirates expected..."
