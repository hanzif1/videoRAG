Behind the sofa, the wall displays the Dinner Table Belonging logo, surrounded by a few green plants that add warmth to the setting. Deepak is seated on the right side of the sofa. One by one, pairs or small groups of two or three team members from HAM join him on the sofa. They play light-hearted games and chat with each other using Indian Sign Language. Throughout the video, lively visual elements appear, such as popular internet memes, playful visualizations of the answers, and short clips from well-known movies, adding humor and energy to the conversation. The visuals complement the flow of signing, making the atmosphere fun, engaging, and expressive. | Hear A Million"
