Dustpans also have a long history that is not well-documented. However, we do know that Lloyd Ray, a Black inventor born in 1860, made a significant contribution to the design of dustpans in the late 1800s. He designed a dustpan that included a brush with a long wooden handle so that users would not have to get down on the floor to clean. He paired this with a steel collection box that could hold reasonably large amounts of refuse, eliminating the need to empty the dustpan every few minutes. Ray received a patent for his dustpan design on August 3, 1897. Today, Ray’s design is still used in many industrial dustpans as well as those intended for the home. Notably, it has also helped inspire the creation of similar tools, including popular pet waste scoopers.Share this article..."

Discussion For me, its by far the most brutal trap, and the only one that makes me more \"sad\" than disgusted. The desperation that the Timothy actor (Mpho Koaho) managed to sell us was completely impeccable, he and Peter Outerbridge (Willam Easton) had the best performances as victims in the whole franchise. (William was the player, not the victim, but he still applies to what I said by the fact that he died in a trap.)

Then you are reminded of the power of a vacuum, and how hard it is to overcome one when you are the only one in the room. In the end, you have to call three friends and uncle Tim (the Toolman type) to get one or two free.Generally, you wrap your feet around the bottom bucket and it works, but that REALLY is a slippery slope. It, as often as not, doesn't go as well as planed and hoped. Likely as not, you manage to turn a stack of buckets into two stacks of buckets.To overcome the vacuum problem, I've wondered why bucket manu..."

No problems until recently and nothing was changed previous to the glitch. Researching the problem hasn’t produced a solution. On a newly created face, the push/pull tool acts like a move tool. If I draw a polygon on that face and try to push/pull again, nothing at all happens. Push/Pull works fine on an existing face of an earlier model. Push/Pull does not work on a previous model if I make a new face on it. The paint bucket only shows as the color picker. I can choose a color in the palette or the model, but can’t fill with color. Paint bucket doesn’t work on new or old geometry. I eventually performed a full re-install of Windows with the same results. Rooting around the 'net, it seems that this problem ha..."

Although there were some visual aids in the medieval period, like convex lenses for magnification and early versions of sunglasses using smoky quartz, it was not until the 1200s that glasses were made to correct vision. The first recorded pair of glasses was made in 1284 in central Italy, probably in Pisa. These were made from glass-blown lenses set in leather or wooden frames. The wearer would hold them..."

It's a celebration of red and pink hued fruits together - strawberries, beetroot and pomegranate! I love starting my day on a healthy note and this smoothie bowl is incredibly healthy, filling and super-delicious. Of all the smoothies and smoothie bowls like this 3 layer winter smoothie and Mango colada smoothie bowl on blog, this bright pink smoothie bowl is probably one of the most delicious and satisfying ever. First things first, a smoothie bowl is different than smoothie. It's much thicker and creamier so that it can be eaten with a spoon and doesn't have a flowing consistency like smoothies.

Posted on December 23, 2011 | 4 Comments Now all we need is food. One of the jobs I don’t usually list on my résumé is “busboy”.  For some reason, it doesn’t seem to impress anyone that while I was in college, I spent a summer working in the dining room of a resort hotel.  Trust me, I’ve had worse jobs — “elf” at an amusement park, for instance — and being a busboy was very educational. Because my job responsibilities included setting tables for banquets, I learned how utensils and glassware are supposed to be placed for formal dining.  That knowledge comes in handy every once in a while, like when I’m at a wedding reception or retirement party or — well, any event where a table that would comfortably seat six people is set for eight.

Since the kite is not drawn accurately, we assume the sides are \\(n + 2\\), \\(n\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n + 2\\). Step 2: Set up the equation for the perimeter: \\((n + 2) + n + n + (n + 2) = 96\\). Step 3: Combine like terms: \\(4n + 4 = 96\\). Step 4: Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(n\\): \\(4n = 92\\). Step 5: Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\(n\\): \\(n = 23\\).
