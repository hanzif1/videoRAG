Members • Iamscotty553 Ranking Talent Show Judges Who Perform on Said Show [DISCUSSION] I’m curious to get everyone’s rankings on singers who are judges on talent shows and also perform during the season. Some performances make you think, “This is exactly why they’re a judge!” while others are more like, “Wait… why are they a judge?” For example, when Demi Lovato performed Give Your Heart a Break on The X Factor—where would you rank her compared to other judge performances?

I've been working on a number of projects, taking online courses in Web Development and UX to better improve this site, and am continuing to build the database. While I'm doing all of this I've also been applying to jobs, and auditioning! I wanted to share a few of my recent videos where I also share tips about the auditions I've been going to. I've been sharing these videos to my own artist social channels, but I think that they'd definitely come in handy over here as well. I also haven't really talked about this project on my social media pages in a while since I have been so wrapped up just trying to stay on my feet, so be on the look out for that soon as well.

Posted on 3 October 20253 October 2025Bog Oak Spoons The family of bog oak spoons has continued to grow over the summer. The two on the right-hand side have just been started. I have a small chunk left and think I will continue with this theme. The two pieces of bog oak came from the fens in East Anglia. Google has it that bog oak from this region is often about 3,500 years old. This old preserved wood doesn’t seem to be as dense as it is described, but that could be due to the fact that it may not have been dried out as carefully as it should have been when it was unearthed. It seems to have lost structural intergrity in the fibres and some parts of the grain are quite soft and prone to splinterin..."

Here’s a lovely art project that makes a super outdoor display that I like because it’s so doable by one teacher with a large class of children.

Nov. Verfasst von Lukas Schubnell Time: According to the latest marketing stats by Facebook, people spend 1.7 seconds on average on a piece of content on mobile compared to 2.5 seconds on a desktop pc,  before they scroll on to the next piece of content in their news feed.

Early Silk Road contacts brought religions—Buddhism, Manichaeism, Nestorianism—and their pictorial traditions, fostering mutual influence in painting between Sasanian Persia and Han-to-Tang China. The 13th-century Mongol conquests unified the two regions under the Yuan dynasty and Il-Khanid Persia, intensifying trade and human movement.

In 2019, while on a week-long camping trip along the coast of Algarve in Portugal, I stumbled upon the art of Eco-printing. Although I wrote an article about my experience at the time, it has taken me four years to finally share it with you! During our trip, we visited the enchanting village of Alté. Its charm led us to explore further, and we stumbled upon an artisanal gallery called Gadjodilo. There, we met Vanessa, an arti..."

Posted by Anil Polat | Oct 2, 2012 | Security, Travel | 12 30 SharesShareTweetPin I routinely disregard the process of making anything more than highly-flexible yet primitive travel plans, however the one thing every traveler should prepare for is how to get from the airport (if flying in) to where you’re staying.
