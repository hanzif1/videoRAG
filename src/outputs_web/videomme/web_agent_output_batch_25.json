Well, now I have decided that I simply can’t wait any longer – I will write it now, without having seen the final series. In fact, I think this is a fitting moment to forumulate my thoughts, simply because Suchet has just started filming Curtain, thus initiating the final year of filming for the series, after which he will have done all the stories and portrayed the character on screen for no less than 25 years!David Suchet’s achievement with Agatha Christie’s character cannot be praised highly enough.

It was only a number of years later that I ever read any of the books, so the Suchet adaptations have always had a special importance for me.

From Albert Finney to Peter Ustinov, I've seen so many takes on this story, and each has been so different. Hercule Poirot is such a popular, well-known and beloved character in British literature, and I'm sure that everybody would have an opinion of how they think he should be played. For Kenneth Branagh to choose to take on the role was, in my eyes, a really bold move. Having played..."

Mercy By far the most the most annoying Hero to play against they reverted the damage boost nerf and now its back to getting obliterated by Mercy pocket if they are good or your tank dying because the Mercy pocket is so bad. Annoying tank res also winning many games in the last moments when she flys in untouchable just unfun to play against. Doomfist Horrible to play against also but i guess takes a lot more skill than Mercy and is also fun to play that’s why he gets the number 2 spot instead of Mercy. He certainly feels over the top right now in the right hands. Zarya What no Sombra you say? Well no because a good Sombra takes a decent amount of skill unlike Zarya who right now is way over the top for little skill required to play her.

Fortunately, LCS teams have been keeping it interesting with roster swaps, compositions, and occasionally the power of friendship. Let's get it.**1. 100 Thieves: 21-9 (Summer 10-2)** 100 Thieves have been so consistent, I sometimes feel like I could easily copy and paste the same thing over and over every week and no one would notice, since it would still be blanket praise of what is currently the best team in the LCS. I've talked a lot about Closer and Abbedagge in previous weeks, so this particular week I'm going to pivot to the 100 Thieves bottom lane and give them the spotlight. They make it pretty easy to do so given the flexibility showcased by both Huhi and FBI over the last few weeks. No team in the ..."

Keep in mind that item can be upgraded; if you purchased the prerequisite for an item, you don’t need to pay that part of the new item (the cost is subtracted from the full cost of one item). The first phase, also called laning phase, begins with two heroes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, and two in the bottom lane. This is the standard configuration and you shouldn’t try to change it unless you have good reasons. Having one person in the midd..."

Conflict is the heart of every story. Without conflict, there's no reason for the audience to care. Conflict creates tension, drives the plot forward, and makes the characters grow.

By AJ Willingham, CNN Published October 19, 2020 Manipulated videos, audio and images have been around for years, but the rise of artificial intelligence and advanced editing software have made them much, much harder to spot. It’s a dangerous new world, where our very sense of reality can be thrown into doubt. Usually, we think of this deception in terms of political tricks. Several videos and images passed around during this US presidential campaign have turned out to be doctored. But the trickery goes deeper than that, and these manipulated pieces of content can emerge in unexpected forms. Telephone scams, catfishing schemes and social media trolling campaigns can all be launched with such fakery, and they can create equally unexpected consequences. Here are some tips on how to spot sophisticated fakes and keep your sense of reality aligned with the truth. Spotting fake ..."

The Baltimore Bridge Collapse was the first time I had to question whether a video I was seeing was real or AI-generated. It was 3 am, and I did what I was trained to do when you can't get to the scene. Make calls. Journalists are trained to know who to call and when. Just writing this is giving me flashbacks to my journalism classes at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. Thanks to this training, I was able to verify that a ship had hit the bridge and an active search was underway. I'm honored to be nominated for two Emmy awards for our coverage. But it's a story I wish had never happened. My heart goes out to the victims, their families, and everyone impacted. | Lindsey Mastis"
