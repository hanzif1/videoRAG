In this article, we walk through how to get started and share our best practices.Last year, we shared lessons in building effective agents alongside our customers. Since then, we've released Claude Code, an agentic coding solution that we originally built to support developer productivity at Anthropic.Over the past several months, Claude Code has become far more than a coding tool. At Anthropic, we’ve been using it for deep research, video creation, and note-taking, among countless other non-coding applications. In fact, it has begun to power almost all of our major agent loops.In other words, the agent harness that powers Claude Code (the Claude Code..."

I get twenty-five\" can be translated into an algebraic equation. Let's represent the unknown number with the variable 'x'. Doubling the number is represented as 2x. Adding eleven to the doubled number results in 2x + 11. The statement indicates that this expression equals twenty-five. Therefore, the equation is: 2x + 11 = 25 The answer is: **2x + 11 = 25** ☆**Question b:** **Solve the equation 2x + 11 = 25** Step 1: **Isolate the term with the variable 'x'.** Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 11 - 11 = 25 - 11 2x = 14 Step 2: **Solve for 'x'.** Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 14/2 x = 7 The answer is: **7** Click to rate:92.4(1037 vote..."

Open Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers. Authors, Editors and Institutions We are a community of more than 103,000 authors and editors from 3,291 institutions spanning 160 countries, including Nobel Prize winners and some of the world’s most-cited rese..."

Bones, shells, fur, skin, footprints, feathers and leaves can all become fossils.Fossils can be very large or very small. The smallest fossils are called microfossils and are only visible with a microscope. Pollen fossils are microfossils. Fossils you can see with your eyes are called macrofossils and can be several meters long and weigh several tons. An example of a macrofossil could be a petrified tree or a dinosaur bone.Preserved remains are defined as fossils if they are older than 10,000 years old.
