We haven’t talked about dark matter for some time. Which is why today I want to tell you how my opinion about dark matter has changed over the past twenty years or so. In particular, I want to discuss whether dark matter is made of particles or if not, what else it could be. Let’s get started. First things first, dark matter is the hypothetical stuff that astrophysicists think makes up eighty percent of the matter in the universe, or 24 percent of the combined matter-energy. Dark matter should not be confused with dark energy. These are two entirely different things. Dark energy is what makes the universe expand faster, dark matter is what makes galaxies rotate faster, though that’s not the only thing dark matter does, as we’ll see in a moment. But what is dark matter? 20..."

To find the average time to complete one lap of the velodrome, we need to find the total time taken for the 5 laps and then divide it by 5. Looking at the diagram, we can see that the stopwatch started at 2.00 s and ended at 81.21 s after 5 circuits. To find the total time, we subtract the starting time from the ending time: 81.21 s - 2.00 s = 79.21 s. Then, we divide the total time by the number of laps: 79.21 s / 5 = 15.84 s.

GPT-4o is a multimodal and multilingual generative pretrained transformer model released in May 2024 by artificial intelligence (AI) developer OpenAI. It is the flagship large language model (LLM) in the GPT-4 family of AI models, which also includes GPT-4o mini, GPT-4 Turbo and the original GPT-4. The “o” in GPT-4o stands for omni and highlights that GPT-4o is a multimodal AI model with sound and vision capabilities. This means it can accept prompt datasets as a mixture of text, audio, image and video input. GPT-4o is also capable of image generation. GPT-4o brings multimedia input and output capabilities to the same transformer-powered GPT-4 intelligence fueling the other models in its line. Revealed in May 2024 as part of OpenAI’s Spring Updates, ChatGPT’s new model appeared to translate spoken language in real ti..."

When I watched the movie I was not ok with the fact that the Joker crashed his car and Batman could only get Harley. That doesn't make sense, the Joker had to escape a car underwater and swim to safety in the few seconds it took Batman to jump in. And he crashed his car in the first place. Doesn't add up. So here's my theory: The Joker could have made some kind of deal with Batman. Joker gives up Harley, Batman lets Joker escape.
