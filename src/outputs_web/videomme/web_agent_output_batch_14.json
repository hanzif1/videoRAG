Artists started signing their works around the 15th century, and while their signatures are most commonly on the front, in more recent times they have often been applied to the reverse.

Theory Of The Experiment For entities to mature, grow, maintain tissues, repair and synthesize new cells, cell division is required. Cell division is of two types: Mitosis Meiosis Mitosis In mitosis, the nucleus of the Eukaryotic cells divides into two, subsequently resulting in the splitting of the parent cells into two daughter cells. Hence, every cell division involves two chief stages: Cytokinesis – Cytoplasm division Karyokinesis – Nucleus division Stages Of Mitosis The various stages of mitosis are: 1. Prophase The process of mitosis is initiated at this stage wherein coiling and thickening of the chromosomes occurs Shrinking and hence the disappearance of the nucleolus and nuclear membrane takes place The stage reaches its final state when a cluster of fibres organizes to form the spindle fibres 2. Metaphase Chromosomes turn thick in this phase. The two chromatids from each ..."
