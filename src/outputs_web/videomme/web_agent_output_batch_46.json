Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) was a fervent supporter of the French Revolution and his talent brought him to the highest levels of French society.

Encouraged by his mischievous companion the ox, he stole their clothes and waited to see what would happen. The fairy sisters elected the youngest and most beautiful sister Zhinü (simplified Chinese: 织女; traditional Chinese: 織女; pinyin: zhī nǚ; literally \"[the] weaver girl\", the star Vega) to retrieve their clothing. She agreed to do so, but since Niulang had seen her naked, she agreed to his request for marriage. She proved to be a wonderful wife, and Niulang to be a good husband. They lived happily and had two children. But the Goddess of Heaven (or in some versions, Zhinü's mother) found out that Zhinü, a fairy girl, had married a m..."

Spartacus was a Thracian in Ancient times, he no doubt would have been exposed to slavery on a mundane daily basis even before he was captured. Abolitionism as a political ideology morally opposed to slavery is a relatively modern thing, and I find it hard to imagine that Spartacus, who w..."

Use public static variables b. Write classes so they are immutable c. Use ThreadLocal variables d. Use Final classes e. Annotate a class with @Multithread 这题考的是java线程安全的理解。 只有有状态的对象才会有线程安全问题。 通常解决线程安全的方法有两个 加锁顺序访问关键资源(牺牲时间）每个线程单独一个资源副本(牺牲空间） 其中b的意思将类写为不可变的，就是没状态的，从根本上解决问题。（例如spring的service ， dao 等无状态 beans） c是第2种解决方案。 a 是制造线程安全隐患 d.只是令到类不能被继承 e. 我没见过@Mutithread 这注解 答案: bc 2) Under which of the following conditions will an alert message be displayed for the Java script code given below <form name=”frm”> <label for=äge”> Please enter your birthday</label> <input type =”text” name=äge” id=äge” onblur=”validate(t..."

I think humanity is no more important than the rest of the natural world, yet we do tend to think ourselves above it in many ways. You can also apply this kind of thinking to relationships with friends, family and strangers. No person is better than any other, and I think a lot of people forget that.”Matt Ortiz Hailing from Albury, Australia on the border of New South Wales and Victoria, 24-year-old singer songwriter Matt Ortiz wrote his first song titled ‘Hangman’s Noose‘ when he was only 17.

The goal of video segmentation is to identify and separate different objects from the background and temporal events in a video and to provide a more detailed and structured representation of the visual content.It’s a crucial task for the fields of computer vision and multimedia—it allows for the identification and characterization of individual objects and events in the video, as well as for the organ..."

If you study Latin, or ancient Greek, or the ancient world in any way at all, I bet at some point you’ve been asked why. Why study dead languages? Why study long-dead people? And I’m sure you have your own answers! I’m going to dedicate this post to my answer… channeled through the medium of Lego for International Lego Classics Day. Firstly, it’s worth pointing out that the Latin and ancient Greek languages are NOT DEAD! They never died. They just developed new features and over time became different enough, or associated with newer political or social or geographical entities, to get relabelled as different languages. Italian, Catalan, French, Romanian, Spanish,..."

At its beginning, multicelled animals underwent a dramatic \"explosion\" in diversity, and almost all living animal phyla appeared within a few millions of years. At the other end of the Paleozoic, the largest mass extinction in history wiped out approximately 90% of all marine animal species. The causes of both these events are still not fully understood and the subject of much research and controversy. Roughly halfway in between, animals, fungi, and plants colonized the land, the insects took to the air, and the limestone shown in the photo at right was deposited near Burlington, Missouri. The Paleozoic took up over half — approximately 300 million years (542 mya to 251 mya)* — of the Phanerozoic.

Up to 96% of the species of marine invertebrates and ∼70% of the terrestrial vertebrates died off. A lot of factors were suggested and substantiated to explain this mass mortality, such as the disappearance of environmental niches in the course of the amalgamation of the continental plates into Pangea, sea level fluctuations, a..."
