In order to remove debug intrinsics from IR we need to first improve the expressiveness of the instruction-moving APIs. This RFC proposes a way to achieve that, with a couple of remaining question marks. A while back in Prototyping a not-an-instruction dbg.value I suggested a pathway towards storing variable location debug-info in something that wasn’t an intrinsic. The benefits are faster -g compiles, and more robust compilation as the presence of debug-intrinsics can interfere with optimisations. We’ve got a prototype at [0] that can build a clang-3.4 binary with no dbg.value int..."

That seems like a shame to me. In the old days this feature was buggy and many people ended up avoiding it. But now I leave them on all the time. The reason is simple — sync locks allow you to make complex trims on multi-track sequences all day long and still be in sync when you’re done. Specifically, it means that when you’re trimming, you can ignore any track that contains black at the blue cursor. No more need to create add-edits in black and put rollers on them. And no need to get rid of those add-edits later. You can go from the first image below to the second in one step. Even though trim rollers are only on V1 and A1, everything stays in sync, and all downstream clips move forward. In some cases, the blue cursor doesn’t necessarily need to be parked over black for sync..."

Emperor penguins form tight huddles of thousands, taking turns rotating from the freezing outer edge to the warm center. This behavior keeps their body temperature stable and protects chicks from deadly winds that can drop below -60 degrees Celsius. Scientists found that the huddle moves like a wave with each penguin shifting slightly every 30 to 60 seconds to keep the group balanced. It's one of the most incredible examples of teamwork in the animal kingdom. | Auto Viral"

                "detail": "What is Screen Direction in Filmmaking - Assemble ProductionWhat is Screen Direction in FilmmakingScreen Direction DefinedScreen direction is important in editing. Directors shoot a scene using various framing and angles. An editor might have a wide master shot of the entire scene from start to finish and then a variety of camera movements taken from various angles and sizes (medium-shots, close-ups, extreme close-ups, inserts).  When piecing these together to form a cohesive scene, it’s important that the director make choices with the camera that keep the screen direction consistent.  So what is screen direction? It is the direction that actors or objects appear to be moving on screen from the point of view of the camera or audience.  If you’re shooting a dialogue scene and you’ve placed the camera over the left shoulder of one actor to capture the other?  To be consistent with screen direction, when you turn around to match that shot from the other actor’s perspective, you should pl..."

Specific camera movements help change the audience’s view without cutting; they can be a great way to make your video more immersive and engaging. When it comes to User-Generated Video, you might not be able to control the type of footage you receive. Luckily for you, many of these movements can be added in post-production.Why are Camera Movements Used?Camera movement can add a lot of meaning to your footage, changing and shaping a viewer’s perspective of a scene. It’s essential to understand how your viewers interpret different types before adding in pans, zooms, tilts, and the like.We’re going to break..."
