So, a player chatted “Sample Text”, and I want to make a script that changes that message “Sample Text” to “Sample Text Added”, basically add that BONUS WORD to the player’s message. Is it possible? Because I’ve seen several games do so. AND IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE NECESSARILY “Sample Text”, it could be anything. If you don’t want to write an entire script completing this operation, at least give me a better understanding on how I accomplish it. I will appreciate all kinds of help, thank you. 3 Likes icy_oasis (icy_oasis) August 22, 2023, 6:06pm 2 In the light of the still fairly new TextChatService, I suggest taking a look at the flowchart displayed on this page: In-Experie..."

Aahana Swrup June 28, 2025 FacebookTwitterPinterestRedditEmail In ‘Squid Game,’ Player 125, aka Min-su, has been an intriguingly unpredictable part of the player pool since the beginning. He survives the first half of the Game in season 2 by partnering up with Se-mi, only to ultimately betray her trust and join Thanos’ posse. An incredibly lucky streak, a mousy disposition, and an inclination for hiding away from trouble prove to be his greatest strengths that somehow help him progress farther than anyone would’ve guessed. As a result, when season 3 begins, he is one of the surviving players who go on to participate in the rest of the vicious levels.

The shape is a rectangle with a semicircle on one side. The rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 7 cm. Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by \\( \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\). So, the area of the rectangle is \\( 12 \\times 7 = 84 cm^2 \\). Step 3: Calculate the area of the semicircle. The area of a semicircle is half the area of a circle with the same radius. The radius of the semicircle is half the width of the rectangle, which is \\( \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5 cm \\). The area of a circle is \\( \\pi r^2 \\), so the area of the semicircle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (3.5)^2 \\). Step 4: Since the radius of the semicircle is given in centimeters, we can use \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\) to approximate the area. The area of the semicircle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3.14 \\times (3.5)^2 \\approx 19..."

The IMD World Competitiveness ranking analyzes the capacity of countries to create and maintain wealth at enterprise level. However, enterprises operate in a national environment which enhances or hinders their ability to compete domestically or internationally.

Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work or art. Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures. The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known..."

Let's denote the number of apples the first child picked as x. The second child picked x - 57 apples. The first and second child together picked 200 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x - 57) = 200. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x - 57 = 200. Adding 57 to both sides, we get: 2x = 257. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 128.5.

In a biblical context, endeavoring often involves striving to live according to God's will, pursuing righteousness, and working diligently in service to God and others. The concept of endeavor is closely tied to themes of perseverance, diligence, and faithfulness.Biblical References and Themes:1. Diligence in Faith and Works: The Bible frequently encourages believers to be diligent in their faith and works. In 2 Peter 1:5-7 , the apostle Peter exhorts believers to \"make every effort to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly ki..."

And so I want to do that tonight.

Members • tarnishedhalo98 Deutsch What's an actually valid enough reason for a character to leave and cut everybody off? Discussion I read a book last year so horribly written I finally decided to write my own, purely out of spite. I've toyed with a lot of different ideas over the years, but I landed on my first book being a romance because I've found it's one of the less complicated genres to nail for me. I'm also a lot better at character driven work over plot-forward writing, so I landed here. I'd say it's definitely lit-fic, for context, and probably leaning YA with mature themes. Also challenging myself with writing a decent book in first person, because I've historically gone with third person limited. It's a small-town, ..."

You should. Without a rock-solid motivation, your characters risk coming across as boring and flat. But if you can give your characters intriguing motivations, you can write a story that truly resonates with readers. That's because motivation is the engine that powers character-driven stories. Plus, it's fun and easy to figure out what makes a character tick. In this two-part article, I'll show you how. If you've read any of my other columns here on Fiction University, you know that I'm a big believer in acronyms. An acronym not only breaks down complicated concepts clearly and simply, it als..."

''Friend of My Youth'' is Ms. Munro's seventh book, and in this superb collection of stories she once again brings to life the territory she has made familiar. Ms. Munro was a Depression baby, born among people in whom spiritual frugality has lingered as a habit. They are fierce people, a reader judges from Ms. Munro's earlier fiction, people who hide their nobler feelings like shameful secrets lest softness be used against them, and who bury their reading (''All things are alive. Spinoza'') among scraps of farm receipts. Deeply suspicious, deeply reverent, they ritualize their poverty and their conformity..."

Our experience of them comes in different ways and through different senses. The following are the basic elements: Theme The theme is the central idea of the production. It can be clearly stated through dialogue, bodily movements, and gestures or kinesthetic movements (dance), songs, or can be inferred after watching the entire performance. It may touch on any aspect of life. It may concern itself with love, courage and nationalism, politics, greed, myths, legends, and one's search for happiness. Usually, the better the theme, the better is the presentation. 2. Plot The plot is the story line. It is what is happ..."
