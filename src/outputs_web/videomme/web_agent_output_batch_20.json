SANVT shows the different interpretations of the divisive style and gives tips on how you can pull off the look smartly. Tucking in the T-shirt all the way into the trousers, or only tucking it in at the front or not tucking it in at all? There is no right or wrong!

Preparation is key: choosing the right T-shirt Before starting to tuck, the one item of clothing that should be chosen most carefully for this look is the T-shirt.

Step 2: Use the given condition that \\(y=63\\) when \\(x=4\\) to find the value of \\(k\\). Substitute \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=63\\) into the equation to get \\(63 = k(4-1)^2\\). Step 3: Calculate the value of \\(k\\) by solving the equation: \\(63 = k \\cdot 9\\), which simplifies to \\(k = 7\\). Step 4: Now that we have the value of \\(k\\), we can write the equation as \\(y = 7(x-1)^2\\). Step 5: To find \\(y\\) when \\(x=6\\), substitute \\(x=6\\) into the equation: \\(y = 7(6-1)^2\\). Step 6: Calculate \\(y\\): \\(y = 7 \\cdot 25\\), which gives \\(y = 175\\). Therefore, the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x=6\\) is \\(175\\).Click to rate:41(61 votes)Search questionBy textBy image/screenshotDrop your file here orClick Hereto uploadMore than just a t..."

It’s tiny and, if you can get there, accommodation is in the owner’s house and meals are taken with the family. This isn’t at all surprising as there are no streets, shops or other amenities – and that is undoubtedly the attraction. We disembarked at Carcass Island as part of our Peregrine Expedition through the Falklands, South Georgia Island and Antarctica. It was only a whistle-stop in the afternoon with just enough time to walk across the isthmus to the windward side. Here we saw Magellanic penguins, but it wasn’t until I returned to the beach on the lee of the island that I met lots of Gentoo penguins.
