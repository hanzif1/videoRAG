The defending 2025 monobob world champion put on a spectacular show in the first race of the World Cup season. Love was electric in the first heat, finishing just one hundredth off first place. She looked poised to clinch the win in heat two, however, a slight bump in the final two corners robbed Love of some speed and dropped her just 0.15 seconds behind two-time world champion Laura Nolte of Germany in the overall standings. Behind Love, Kaillie Humphries finished just off the podium in 4th place as she looks to defend her Olympic monobob title in February. Humphries struggled in the start of both of her runs but had impressive final sectors to secure 4th. She is currently the only Olympic monobob champion in history, after the event was adde..."

This, you may remember, was made into a movie in 2003 with Colin Firth in a dreadful wig and Scarlett Johanssen as The Girl. However, it is Chevalier’s tenth novel, published in 2019, that has stuck with me. ‘A Single Thread’ is the story of Violet, a young woman, who, when her fiancé is killed in WWI, becomes trapped at home, caring for her controlling mother. Eventually, determined to assert her independence and chart her own course through life, she moves to Winchester. There, she finds a passion for needlework and become a ‘broderer’ at Winc..."
