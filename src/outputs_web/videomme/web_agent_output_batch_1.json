But archaeologists are increasingly confronted with demands to let past generations rest in peace.ByMark StraussApril 7, 2016•25 min readDan Davis watched on a video screen as an underwater robot explored a ship that had sunk to the bottom of the Black Sea.

Of course, Baby falls in love with Swayze's Johnny Castle, the camp's beloved dance instructor with a bad boy reputation.Although the film, which grossed $150 million worldwide, was a bonafide hit, it was ..."

Cloud formation is part of the water cycle, but one we usually cannot see up close. A cloud is a large collection of very tiny water droplets or ice crystals. The droplets are so small and light that they can float in the air. When warm air rises carrying with it evaporated water, it expands and cools. Cool air cannot hold as much water vapour as warm air, so some of the vapour condenses onto tiny pieces of dust that are floating in the air and forms a tiny droplet around each dust particle. When billions of these droplets come together they become a visible cloud. This demonstration shows how water in the atmosphere can be made visible by changes in pressure and temperature.

The adjacent side is 3 units and the opposite side is 8 units. Step 2: Use the tangent ratio to find the angle \\( \\theta \\). The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. So, \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{3}{8}\\). Step 3: Calculate the angle \\( \\theta \\) using the inverse tangent function. Thus, \\( \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right) \\). Step 4: Compute the value of \\( \\theta \\) using a calculator. The result is approximately \\( \\theta = 20.6^{\\circ} \\). Therefore, the size of angle \\( \\theta \\) to 1 decimal place is \\( 20.6^{\\circ} \\).Click to rate:44.7(47 votes)Search questionBy textBy image/screenshotDrop your file here orClick Hereto uploadMore than just a tutor Solve math p..."

This mixture is usually made up of four parts: a hot liquid base, called the melt; minerals crystallized by the melt; solid rocks incorporated into the melt from the surrounding confines; and dissolved gases. When magma is ejected by a volcano or other vent, the material is called lava. Magma that has cooled into a solid is called igneous rock. Magma is extremely hot—between 700° and 1,300° Celsius (1,292° and 2,372° Fahrenheit). This heat makes magma a very fluid and dynamic substance, able to create new landforms and engage physical and chemical transformations in a variety o..."

Since the price is £0.90 for 25 g, the price for 100 g would be \\( \\frac{100}{25} \\times 0.90 = 4 \\times 0.90 = £3.60 \\). Step 2: Calculate the price for the Spanish website. Since the price is €1.20 for 50 g, the price for 100 g would be \\( \\frac{100}{50} \\times 1.20 = 2 \\times 1.20 = €2.40 \\). Step 3: Convert the €2.40 to pounds using the conversion rate €1 = £0.95. So, \\( 2.40 \\times 0.95 = £2.28 \\). Step 4: Add the delivery cost to the Spanish website's price. The delivery cost is €0.80, which converts to \\( 0.80 \\times 0.95 = £0.76 \\). Step 5: Add the delivery cost to the Spanish website's price in pounds to get the total cost. \\( £2.28 + £0.76 = £3.04 \\). Therefore, Tommy would pay £3.04 for the spice mix from the Spanish website, which is cheaper than the British website.Click to rate:35.8(53 votes)Search quest..."
