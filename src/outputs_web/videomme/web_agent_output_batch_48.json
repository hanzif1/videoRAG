I’d racked up 18 kills—one of my best matches of the season.Then I looked at my hitting percentage: .227My teammate next to me? She had 12 kills but was hitting .389. I was confused. How could she be the more efficient hitter when I had way more kills?That’s when I learned one of the most important lessons in volleyball: kills don’t tell the whole story. Your hitting percentage does.In this guide, I’ll show you exactly how to calculate and understand hitting percentage—the stat that coaches actually care about when evaluating offensive performance.

So, I could write a bunch (have written a bunch) on serve-receive. A Proper Evaluation of Serve-Receive and Proper Serve-Receive (The Director’s Cut), for instance… For those of you under 30, here’s the TL;DR: 3-2-1-0 is not a good system for evaluating passes. For everyone else: The 3->0 system treats the differences between a 3 and 2, a 2 and 1, and a 1 and 0 all equally. The thing is, they ARE NOT equal differences. You improve your offense 9,940% or so when you go from 0 to 1 and you improve 400% when you go from 1 to 2 and only 30% or so going from 2 to 3. Thus, the passing scale needs to be unbalanced to reflect our chances of scoring based properly on our hitting in those situations. Make sense? That’s how I got to 5-4-1-0…though that rounded t..."

Members • GunzBlazein180 Français日本語Bahasa Melayuไทย New to watching football, what happens if bvb wins next game 2-1 Basically my cousin did a terrible job explaining the way champions league works. He said if the next game is tied, athletico Madrid would advance since they scored more goals. So then I asked him what if the game ends 2-1 with bvb winning. He said it would go to extra time which makes no sense because how can u be winning 2-1 in overtime and still have the game go to extra time? Something isn’t adding up can someone explain?

Football managers often have half-baked ideas on their tactics or new players to sign, but they never instruct their team to score half-a-goal because, well, that’s an impossibility. That’s one of the reasons why punters get so confused about the .5 goals lines that the bookmakers offer. You can’t score half a goal, that’s a given. But when you understand the logic of the 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and so on goal line, and what the numbers mean, it becomes so easy to follow and unearths a potentially profitable betting market for savvy punters. It’s the sort of thing you only need to learn once, and it’s so simple that you can never forget how it works, so this article will hopefully unlock a new betting market for anyone who has never used it before.

Of course there are different reasons for a referee to give a free kick or yellow card. I've looked at minute-by-minute data of every Premier League match since 2009/2010 from whoscored.com, which provides a description along ..."

Members • DamnThatsInsaneLol Rodrygo was better than Vini in both the matches Brazil played this international break Discussion I hope Xabi uses Rodrygo more often when Vini isn't performing. He did well this international break. Against Senegal he got 1 assist, 3 shots, 25 accurate passes (86%), 5 duels won, rated 8.0 in fotmob. Against Tunisia he got 34 accurate passes (97%), 5 duels won, 1 tackle won, rated 7.6. We have 2 world class LWs in Vini and Rodrygo. No reason to just let one rot in the bench when there's plenty of opportunity to let both play, especially when Vini is inconsistent in his performances these days. Competition breeds improvement. We have to encourage it. Als..."

As far back as the late 1800’s, during the summer months training gymnasts in Germany and Sweden would move their sessions to the beach, performing somersaults and twists over the water as part of their training. This was referred to as “fancy diving”. The act of diving into water before swimming was referred to as plain diving. Plain diving first became an Olympic sport in 1904 and today is one of the most popular Olympic events with spectators.

In the 50m freestyle, for example, some competitors don't breathe at any point during the race. Freestyle swimming has been included in every modern Olympics. Currently, freestyle is contested in more Olympic events than any other stroke, at distances of 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, and 1500m. There are also two freestyle relay events per gender, a 4..."

JustOneUSer Oct 3, 2017 0 #2 If you beat players that were much below your level, (that you are expected to beat) you can get usually 5-7 points. If you win when a draw was expected, about 8, maybe 8 or 9. 10 or 11 is beating someone you were expected to loose agsint. If you play and beat someone 500 points beneath your level, sometimes you can only win 2 or so points. Same deal for loosing. And for drawing games. JustOneUSer Oct 3, 2017 0 #3 Does that help?

To preface this. I've seen this question before, and the top answer is always something that ridicules the notion that you could ever even dream of winning a single point. Obviously none of us could win a game, but I do believe even a decent player could win 1 point.

What if you wanted to present a show with more substance? How do you pick a set list of magic with meaning? How do you normally plan your magic show? I start with the tricks. I make a set list of tried-and-true routines. Begin with a proven opener, a big closer, and fill in the middle.

Posted on 4th June 2018 by Scoop Magic The days of magicians wearing top hats and tails has truly gone and thanks to Dynamo and David Blaine it is no longer essential that a magician even dresses particularly smartly. Different magicians have different approaches when it comes to deciding what they should wear for gigs so here are my thoughts on the subject. One approach that I regularly hear when magicians discuss this issue (magicians’ conversations aren’t just about illusions and glamorous assistants, we also discuss really exciting stuff like clothes and hand care!) is that a magician’s appearance should be one level above that of their audience.

And what I like even more is sewing their carnival costumes. Every year, it’s a pleasure for me to plan it with them, listen to their desires, choose a pattern, fabrics. I feel like a good fairy who will fulfill their wishes. And what a joy to see their eyes shine! This year, Tom wanted to disguise himself as a magician. We took the time to brainstorm the idea: via Pinterest, Google, we researched, refined the costume he wanted, until he made this sketch, on a silhouette I Had pre-drawn. He wanted a long jacket, lined with red, a belt and a bow tie.

Let's assume Denver consumes x avocados per year and Phoenix consumes y avocados per year. The difference in consumption is y - x. To express this as a percentage of Denver's consumption, we divide the difference by x and multiply by 100. Percentage difference = (y - x) / x * 100 Since the question asks for the percentage more that Phoenix consumes compared to Denver, we can rearrange the equation to solve for y: y = x + (x * percentage difference / 100) Let's assume the percentage difference is p. y = x + (x * p / 100) Now, we can substitute the given answer choices to find the correct percentage difference. 20%: y = x + (x * 20 / 100) = x + 0.2x = 1.2x 36%: y = x + (x * 36 / 100) = x + 0.36x = 1.36x 40%:..."
