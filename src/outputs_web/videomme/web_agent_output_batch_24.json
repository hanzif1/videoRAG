The Zwicky Transient Facility has detected 100,000 supernovae and classified 10,000 of them. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a wide-field astronomical survey named after the prolific Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky. In the early 1930s, Zwicky and his colleague Walter Baade coined the term 'supernova' to describe the transition of normal main sequence stars into neutron stars. In the 1940s, Z..."

Although the rocks that record the earliest parts of Earth’s history have been destroyed or deformed over time by more than four billion years of geology, scientists can use modern rocks, moon samples, and meteorites to figure out when and how the Earth and moon formed, and what they might once have looked like.

Is Mount Everest getting taller? And what animals live in high climates? All your questions, answered.Alexandra Franklin-CheungPublished: October 11, 2021 at 10:00 amHow do mountains form? Most mountains owe their existence to the movement of tectonic plates, vast sections of the Earth’s crust. Where two tectonic plates converge, they buckle and fold, resulting in the most common type: fold mountains. The Himalayas, for example, result from the Asian and Indian plates slowly colliding. Block mountains are created when the pressures between p..."

These plates continually jockey for position, shaping the array of features visible at the surface. In some places, the plates pull apart, creating valleys in the land. In others, they collide, shoving mountains into the sky..."

By David NaarLast Updated May 20, 2025 Follow Us: Facebook Twitter “Code red” is one of several military slang terms that refers to a form of extrajudicial punishment — a type of punishment that’s carried out without a court’s oversight or any form of legal approval.

You know you’re wading into obscure territories when a movie doesn’t have a Wikipedia page. According to both IMDb and Letterboxd, The Witchmaker is the most obscure movie in 31 Nights of Horror this year. The movie had a limited theatrical in 1969 and was re-released under five different names throughout the early 1970’s, but never gained a significant following.

PART ONE – THE WEAVERS AND RUBY RIDGE Randy Weaver was born in Villisca, Iowa, in 1948. He graduated from high school in 1966, enrolled in community college, and met his future wife, Vicki Jordison. Weaver soon dropped out to join the fight in Vietnam, and although he successfully completed Grenn Beret training he never made it to Vietnam.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Written by Rob Larkin on 11/19/2025 for PC PS5 XSX More On: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is what I imagine a Call of Duty game would look like from a development team that was simply tired of making Call of Duty games. I have no way of knowing if anyone at Treyarch actually felt that way, but it is such a departure from “the formula” it almost feels like a cathartic release of sorts. There are certain expectations for installments in this franchise. While every mode in that expectations checklist is delivered, so much of the game is an attempt to implement new, bigger, and bolder ideas—but not always pulling it off. So, what is “the formula” for a Call of Duty game? Well, we would typically first jump into a single player campaign, complete it, and never touch it again except for maybe one extra ru..."

Video production has become incredibly democratized. Everyone has an HD (or 4K) video camera in their pocket, and distribution is free with your Facebook or Twitter account.
