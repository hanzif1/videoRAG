A Yes Day is a day when parents say yes to any requests from their children. You read that right. A Yes Day means parents are not allowed to say no; and to be honest, that sounds terrifying! Maybe you’re listing in your head all the reasons why a Yes Day sounds like a bad idea for your family, but the truth is that a Yes Day can be beneficial to both parents and children.

Let's start by imagining an arbitrary cross section – something not circular, not rectangular, etc. In the above image, the arbitrary shape has an area denoted by A. We can look at a small, differential area dA that exists some distance x and y from the origin. We can look at the first moment of area in each direction from the following formulas: The first moment of area is the integral of a length over an area – that means it will have the units of length cubed [L3]. It is important because it helps us locate the centroid of an object. The ..."

The reason for this is because of their ability to blend in with the environment they are in at any given time. This is achieved via their auxiliary function of Fe, which I will call their chameleon function. Typically, how this manifests is that an INFJ will be hard to notice. They are hard to see. You could be talking with one and have no idea that you are talking to a person of this type. Because of their chameleon quality, they will embody whatever their delicate gyroscope tells them to embody at any given time. INFJs have a tendency to balance out interactions such that if ..."

These men have told lies to friends and family members, attempted to blackmail their former spouses by threatening to spread vicious lies about them, stolen money from them, tried to turn children against their mothers, become explosively angry, even physically violent when challenged, and have uniformly laid blame for the failure of the marriage at the feet of the ex-wife. I’ve also heard from a couple of men confronting vengeful and narcissistic women in their lives, but with nowhere near the level of vindictiveness displayed by these narcissistic ex-husbands. The viciousness can be quite subtle and sometimes ..."

I had covered this for circular weaving, but was surprised I didn’t cover this for normal weaving yet. Well here it is: My simplest answer to this question is just add the new thread next to the previously woven thread. This is the same for whether you’re weaving in a new color or continuing the same color after your thread ran out. And if you didn’t realize already you can weave in one spot of your warp threads, then weave in a completely different spot and later fill in the empty warp threads. Weaving is really flexible and that is one of the many reasons why I love it.  Don’t be afraid to experiment with how you weave, it wi..."

                "detail": "Principles of Weaving | The Loom Room New Home Contact Select Page Principles of Weaving Weaving is very simple. You essentially have two sets of threads – one set, pre-wound, called the warp, running vertically and kept under tension, and the other set threaded individually through the vertical threads, usually at right angles, called the weft. The simplest method is to use your body to tension the warp threads, which allows you to pack up and carry your whole project with you easily. This technique is is called backstrap weaving, is widely used across the world, especially in nomadic cultures, and can be found largely in Africa, Asia, and South America. The next simplest method is to have a basic frame – just a rectangle – which can be made out of wood, or any kind of tubing that is sturdy enough to take tension without bending. I have seen the Bedouin weavers in Oman weaving on copper pipe tubing fixed into a rectangle. This frame is then strung with a warp running top to bottom, wi..."
