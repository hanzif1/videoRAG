Would this be accomplished by creating the inside of a building in a different scene? (then switching over TO that scene once you approach the door?) If so, then how would you spawn outside the door once you leave? Wouldn’t it just start you wherever the player was placed initially in that scene? The only way around that would be making a scene for every door you exit. (which COULD work, probably a lot more efficient ways of going about this, like perhaps python, which I’m STILL NOT ACQUAINTED WITH YET!!)

Instead I want the player to be able to enter shop or enter hut. I’ve seen the Owen’s Law example but it’s not quite what I want. The player should be able to: > enter shop ... > exit ... > enter shop ... > go outside ... > enter shop ... > leave shop I know that entering relates to containers.
