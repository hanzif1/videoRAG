When you create video content for your site, there are some elements you should include to increase its appeal to your audience. Here are the top ten. Ten Components to Include in Every Video 1. A hook. Your video is competing for viewers’ attention amongst a nearly infinite collection of other content. You have to find a way to stand out — and fast. You may have the best content in the world, but if you don’t convince your viewer to keep watching within the first 15 seconds, they’ll probably click away and never see it. Include a hook at the very beginning of your video to convince your viewers to stay tuned. 2. Optimized orientation. Video-making is not one-size-fits-all. Know your platform and view..."

Perhaps the most adaptable and resilient of all large predators, the leopard’s habitat ranges from South Africa, across the African continent, and all the way to the Korean Peninsula. This widespread range is a testament to the leopard’s versatility. This article will explore the habitat of the African leopard, how it exploits its niche, and answer the question of w..."

Many animals are very territorial: they mark, protect and defend their small nations against the invasion of strangers: their survival depends on it. In some cases they are breeding grounds, in others, they are exclusive sources of food and, in others, their home, where they will raise their newborns... At all times they defend their own borders. #animals #wildlife #documentary | Love Nature"
