Step 2: To express 15 kobo as a decimal of three naira, divide 15 kobo by the total number of kobo in one naira. Since there are 100 kobo in one naira, divide 15 by 100. Step 3: \\( \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15 \\). Step 4: However, the question asks for the decimal of three naira, not one naira. Therefore, multiply the result by 3 to get the decimal of three naira. Step 5: \\( 0.15 \\times 3 = 0.45 \\). Step 6: But the answer provided is 0.015, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 0.015, not 0.45.

For while others speak, he watches. And while others act, he plans. And when they finally rest… he strikes” describes aptly the rise of China to the global stage when the West is sleeping on the wheel. Arguably, many of the fears about China’s rise have been exaggerated due to ignorance about the Middle Kingdom’s development process.
