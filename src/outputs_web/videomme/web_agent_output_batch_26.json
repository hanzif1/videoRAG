Common antecedents to challenging behavior for individuals with autism include: A) Unexpected change in routine C) Denied access to preferred activity (e.g. being told ''no'') D) Sensory overload (e.g. too many people, too loud, too bright, etc.) Rationales: Unexpected changes in routine can disrupt the predictability that individuals with autism often rely on, leading to challenging behaviors. Denied access to preferred activities can trigger frustration and distress, resulting in challenging behaviors. Sensory overload, such as too many people, loud noises, or bright lights, can overwhelm individuals with autism and contribute to challenging behaviors.

Different catalytic and gravimetric experiments were performed dynamically and isothermally at multiple temperatures. Initially, the CO oxidation process was evaluated using a catalytic reactor connected to a gas chromatograph. Once the production of CO 2 was confirmed, its chemisorption capacity with NaCoO 2 was studied gravimetrically. Catalytic and gravimetric analysis products were studied by XRD, FTIR an..."

Quan just turned 14 in March and is the youngest athlete representing China in Tokyo, but she looked like a seasoned veteran from her stance at the top of the platform to the moment she completed a splash-less entry into the pool. In her first major international competition, she totaled a 466.20 to obliterate the previous Olympic record of 447.70 and capture her first gold in dominant fashion. The newest diver in a long line of Chinese Olympic champions took up the sport as a way to financially support her mother who has an illness that requires year-round treatment.

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video proc..."

Key scenes in the play take place during the holiday season. The play was too expensive to be produced on a more frequent basis. George Lillo was one of few playwrights who allowed their work to be performed on holidays. The play's message was considered to be particularly important for apprentices.

I reached out to the curator Bobbi Owen for an interview, and read her monograph of Willa, The Designs of Willa Kim, published in 2005. A slim volume, it focuses on explicating the many various productions Willa worked on each year of her multi-decade career—illuminating how much much Willa worked and how varied the styles she created were.With such a huge output, choosing what to include in a retrospective exhibition can be difficult—I wanted to speak with Bobbi to get a sense of how she approached curating this show, as well as more about her personal experiences with Willa.

Main Argument: The theme is often overlooked in filmmaking, especially short films, but it is crucial for connecting with the audience.

I used the BodyPose Net with COCO Dataset to detect the skeleton of people and their posture. I want to run inference on a video using the different versions of the model (unpruned, pruned_retrained, int8, fp16 and fp32) to compare the times of detection. First, I wonder if I can use the .tlt file directly with TensorRT or do I have to convert them into .etlt or .engine?

I want to share my journey of discovery and how embracing this concept has revolutionized my videos.The Beginning: Struggling with Disconnected ContentWhen I first started making videos, I focused on creating content that highlighted interesting topics and cool effects. I thought if I just made things flashy enough, people would watch. But despite my best efforts, something was missing. My videos weren’t resonating with my audience the way I hoped they would.I remember one evening, scrolling through the comments on my latest video, feeling disheartened by the lack of engagement.
