It would’ve been very nice if we could get see 1930s Uruguay, Sarosi’s Hungary, Sindelar’s Austria and the team with Schiaffino and Varela that beat because everyone who is into history talks about them, but when you don’t have the game footage available, it’s hard for you to know exactly how they played or how good they were.

What makes it even more special today is how it’s been restored using AI tools to correct the speed, add color, and even simulate sound, turning what once looked like a shaky black-and-white blur into a vivid, almost modern glimpse into the late 19th century. | History In Pictures"

                "detail": "Textiles & garments are often intertwined with performance art forms like dance. Drawing from the region’s own textile traditions, the performers’ costumery and adornments take into account ease of movement and the narrative of the act while creating a distinct cultural and regional identity of the dance form itself. The saris worn by Bharatanatyam performers for Nritta (dance) can be a single or combination of multiple textiles. Dancers usually wear cotton saris for practice sessions and silk Kanjeevarams for their main performances that feature on its front a pleated fanned out fabric that get accentuated during leg and knee movements.

Mana-based magic uses spells (imagine Harry Potter but flashier and more complicated) and that using a spell requires the calmness of mind and focus.

Dr. Jay Dudley Uncategorized June 20, 2019 11 Minutes Jung’s theories on archetypes offer a framework for understanding some of the hazards psychologists and psychotherapists can present to an unwitting client body from their natural position as ‘the Magician’. Beware of those operating from the shadow positions of the magician archetype, ‘the detached manipulator’ and ‘the denying innocent one’. “He who says he knows, does not know. He who knows, does not claim to know.” Lao Tzu Work by the likes of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud has almost entirely taken a back seat in the training of clinical psychologists and psychotherapists, with the field’s sights set on the scientific, the measurable and the time-limited.

This allows developers to build powerful applications that can track human movement. By analyzing key body landmarks such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, the Vision framework opens up a wide range of possibilities in fields such as fitness tracking, augmented reality, motion analysis, and even accessibility.In this tutorial, we will understand how we can use the HumanBodyPoseRequest from the Vision framework to detect body poses in a live video feed and show this information using graphical overlays in a SwiftUI app.By the end of this tutorial, you..."

General fla_panther January 2, 2024, 5:53am 1 There are times when I’m definitely not shocked or stunned (because I’m clearly moving my character around the screen), but when I try to either shift or cast a skill (especially Lethal Mirage) I can click the button multiple times before it triggers. I’ve also made sure to confirm that the skill timer has completely reset - there’ve been many times this has happened when I haven’t attempted to use the skill for many seconds after it’s cooldown has expired. I initially noticed it when Shift wouldn’t trigger immediately. At first I thought maybe it was because it triggered when I released the key rather than when I pressed it, but I’ve confirmed that’s not the case because there are times that I’ll just ho..."

This is why higher MMR can stuck easy in lower ranks. No matter how good you are if you have throwers/leavers/potatoes in your team it’s mission impossible to win the game. So for exmaple if your MMR is diamond you will be playing vs other diamond MMR players in silver, hence the reason your rank can be miles away from your actual skills. Q: Why am I hard stuck at a low rating that doesn’t reflect my skill? A: Ultimately, the only way you can increase your rating is to win more matches than you lose. Since we’re putting any given player on a random team with 9 random other players, with enough matches, that player’s contributions are the only constant factor throughout, so the..."
