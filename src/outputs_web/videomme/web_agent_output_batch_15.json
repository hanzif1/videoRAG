For example, in a video of a “man playing a piano”, the video might also contain “another man dancing” or “a crowd clapping”. We introduce the task of dense-captioning events, which involves both detecting and describing events in a video. We propose a new model that is able to identify all events in a single pass of the video while simultaneously describing the detected events with natural language. Our model introduces a variant of an existing proposal module that is designed to capture both short as well as long events that span minutes. To capture the dependencies between the events in a video, our model introduces a new captioning module that uses contextual information from past and future events to jointly describe all events. We also introduce ActivityNet Captions, a large-scale benchmark for dense-captioning events. ActivityNet Captions contains 20k videos ..."

Salty water sinks. Warm water floats. Fresh water floats. Temperature The sea water around the Antarctic continent is always very cold. It can be as cold as -2°C. The sea water around the equator can be very warm. For example the sea temperature around the Persian Gulf can be as warm as 36°C. The average temperature of the sea is about 2°C. The average surface temperature is about 17°C. Cold water is more dense than warm water Cold water is heavier or more dense than warm water. That means that cold water will sink below warm water.

In My Humble Opinion CaerieD October 6, 2008, 2:34pm 1 Inspired by a discussion in this thread. What, specifically, does the word “video” mean to you? For example, if you’re in a movie rental store and something is referred to as being “on video”, what would you assume that means? If it doesn’t make you automatically think of a VHS tape, what media do you most strongly associate a “video” with, or do you associate it with a particular medium at all? Hampshire October 6, 2008, 2:42pm 2 The word by itself to me means the visual part of of media. As in audio/video inputs or the audio department of an electronic store vs. the video department. But honestly is someone uses it in the form “Is that movie on video?” it does make me immediately think VHS. Even though DVD means digital-video-disc I never really hear any one refer to a mo..."

Mainly because the vapour-laden air cools as it rises, a point is reached when the air is no longer able to hold water in the form of vapour. The altitude at which this happens is known to meteorologists as the Lifting Condensation Level. Further cooling by ascent above this level leads to condensation of water vapour in ..."

Classic Episode Guide > Planetary Science > Wind PrintA cool breeze is great on a hot summer day. A cold winter wind can chill you until you can’t stop shivering. Where does all that wind come from? It starts with the Sun. Energy from the Sun warms the Earth and the atmosphere, the air, above it. As the world turns into darkness each night, the atmosphere cools off. The molecules in a mass of warm air are more spread out than the molecules of air in a cold air mass. So cold air is heavier than warm air. Cool air masses squeeze warm air up. That’s why you may hear people say, “Warm air rises.” The Sun warms the Ear..."

I get twenty-five\" can be translated into an algebraic equation. Let's represent the unknown number with the variable 'x'. Doubling the number is represented as 2x. Adding eleven to the doubled number results in 2x + 11. The statement indicates that this expression equals twenty-five. Therefore, the equation is: 2x + 11 = 25 The answer is: **2x + 11 = 25** ☆**Question b:** **Solve the equation 2x + 11 = 25** Step 1: **Isolate the term with the variable 'x'.** Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 11 - 11 = 25 - 11 2x = 14 Step 2: **Solve for 'x'.** Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 14/2 x = 7 The answer is: **7** Click to rate:92.4(1037 vote..."

Object Detection by Color: Using the GPU for Real-Time Video Image Processing Ralph Brunner Apple Frank Doepke Apple Bunny Laden Apple In this chapter, we describe a GPU-based technique for finding the location of a uniquely colored object in a scene and then utilizing that position information for video effects. The technique uses a pixel shader in an atypical manner: to calculate a centroid and area rather than a per-pixel effect. Object detection and tracking have applications in robotics, surveillance, and other fields. As the number of consumers who own computers equipped with video cameras increases, so ..."

We take for granted how easily a plane weighing over half a million pounds lifts off the ground with such ease. How does it happen? The answer is simple. It's engines. Let Theresa Benyo of NASA Glenn Research Center explain more... As featured on NASA's Destination Tomorrow. Jet engines move the airplane forward with a great force that is produced by a tremendous thrust and causes the plane to fly very fast. All jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work on the same principle. The engine sucks air in at the front with a fan. A compressor raises the pressure of the air. The compresso..."

Open Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers.

A gas turbine is a type of internal combustion engine that converts the chemical energy of fuel into mechanical power. It consists of three main components, these are the compressor, combustor, and turbine. The applications of gas turbines are numerous because of their efficiency, cost, and reliability. Gas turbines are also referred to as combustion turbines (they are the same thing). A gas turbine mounted to an aircraft is referred to as a jet engine. Gas Turbine Interesting note: Gas turbines are referred to as gas turbines because they operate using hot gases, not because they burn natural gas! It is possible for gas turbines to burn over 30 different types of fuel, but natural gas is the most common. Basic Gas Turbine Working Principle The basic process of a gas turbine involve..."
