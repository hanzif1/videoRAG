Weather has been very cold in the bay area recently and so most of my workouts have been indoors but I can't wait to get back out very soon. Today I climbed a 127 step stairway while I was in Pacifica. It's located at Oceana High School. I went for a swim at their public pool and wasn't expecting this stairway to pop up. I was thrilled to learn that this stairway is over 100 steps. Not the most ''obsure'' set of steps but steep and easily accessible. Great for getting in repetitions. 0 Comments A Wonderful Stroll in ..."

Marlon Brando will forever be associated with the T-shirt he wears throughout most of A Streetcar Named Desire. It’s an image that crawled into my head some years ago and refused to leave. Brando wears that T-shirt like a second skin, the outer layer that helped him get inside the brutish Stanley Kowalski.

Thus starteth the lesson. This is a short preview of the full bonus episode, which is available exclusively for our Patrons. When I first watched Gangster Squad, I remember that I was floored.

This can make interpreting the behaviour difficult, particularly when based only on a photograph. - Credit: Jane Hendrix Interpreting the meaning behind canid body language, and subsequently categorizing it, is not a straightforward task because there is a striking, albeit superficial, similarity between domination and play. Indeed, anyone who has witnessed domestic dogs playing together will probably have noticed that the ‘rough and tumble’ can appear quite aggressive to the casual human observer.

This is perhaps most familiar to those of us who own dogs and have, based on studies of wolf packs, been told we \"have to show them who's boss\". This hierarchical model was, however, established based on observations of unrelated captive animals who, with nowhere to go (there being no chance of dispersal in captivity), were forced to fight in order to establish a place for themselves in the \"pecking order\" (so-called because it was first documented in chickens).

                "detail": "Our Project Wildlife team has recently taken in multiple raccoons who were being kept as pets. This unfortunate situation serves as an important reminder: Wild animals are not pets and should not be removed from their natural habitat — where they belong. Although raccoons are adorable, they are not domesticated animals. They rely on natural instincts and survival skills that they develop in the wild — like foraging for food, socializing with other raccoons and recognizing dangers. Unfortunately, when raised by humans, they can miss these crucial lessons. Sadly, by the time humans realize that the raccoons they've been keeping shouldn't be pets, the animals can no longer be released back into their natural environment and must be placed in permanent care. Keeping a raccoon as a pet isn’t just harmful to the animal — bringing any wild animal into your home can also present risks for people and pets. While raccoons make great wild neighbors, they are a species that can sometimes carry dis..."
