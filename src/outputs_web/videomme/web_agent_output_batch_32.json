Sure, there may be some “calm” days, but most families face plenty of “stormy” days (or weeks, or months, or years) too. Whether through illness, divorce, death, job loss, struggling children, or just plain “life,” storms roll in–sudden and uninvited–and present families with challenges that are overwhelming and may feel impossible to overcome.

October 20, 2020 by Scott Sheaffer ©Scott Sheaffer, CDBC, CBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, USA Dog Behavior, LLCOf all the creatures on earth, have you ever wondered why humans and dogs seem to really “get each other”? Dogs really enjoy being with us. They appear to read our moods and our motives. They are forgiving of our worst transgressions.

On a November night in 1965, Che Guevara quietly boarded a small boat on Lake Tanganyika. It was the end of his secret mission designed to spark a revolution in Congo.

It’s going to represent everything your business stands for, be relatable to your target audience, use an attractive and meaningful colour palette and have the potential to be iconic.

Everything about Puerto Rican rapper MalaCara’s latest collaborative short, musical film, Toque de Queda en Macondo, is real.
