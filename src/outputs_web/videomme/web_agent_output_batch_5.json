(and why it's important to learn how to spot it) Skip to content MENU Search Search for: Behavior Care Training Facts Health Diet Resources What is a Rabbit Hunched Position? (and why it’s important to learn how to spot it) Written by Amy Pratt in Health When you notice your rabbit sitting in a hunched position, it communicates discomfort or distress. Think of it as if you were curled up on the couch with a stomach ache – your rabbit’s hunched posture is a similar expression of feeling unwell. When healthy and content, rabbits typically display a more relaxed and stretched out posture. A hunched position can be a subtle clue letting you know your rabbit isn’t feeling well. If you see this alongside other signs like a lack of appetite, less droppings, or a decrease in activity, these can be indications that your rabbit needs more care or even a visit to the vet. Since rabbits are prey animals, they have an instinct to hide when they are not feeling wel..."

We can use it to tell us when our rabbits are happy, sad, excited or afraid and that in turn helps us to build better relationships. So what is body language? Body language includes all sorts of non verbal ways to communicate: things like facial expressions, hand movements, posture (how you sit or stand), and gait (how you walk or run). People use body language constantly - we smile when we're happy, wave to acknowledge seeing a friend or drop our heads when we're feeling down. We often don't think about consciously reading or using body language with people as we've grown up communicating that way. Rabbit's use body language too; but rabbit body language is more subtle tha..."

Previously we discussed: Claude Monet’s Rouen Cathedral Paintings Claude Monet’s Haystack Paintings These paintings depict Monet’s flower gardens at his home in Giverny, which were the primary focus of Monet’s paintings for the last 30 years of his life.
