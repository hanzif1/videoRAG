Where else would it be? This week, I’m going to kick off the conversation by continuing a topic that’s emerged over the last couple of posts: choosing a partner. What’s on my mind at the moment is the difference between the way that a fully informed limerent looking for a partner would approach the issue, and how most of us just muddle along. The usual trajectory of dating in my day was: meet someone, feel the glimmer, pursue them, and hope it works out. But in my day (1990s)..."

Having done so, I realised I owned quite a lot of his recordings. Turns out I have bought everything he released during his lifetime. I wondered what it would be like to listen to them all in order, and to write about the experience, each day. This turned out to be a very time consumimng and, at times, painful task because Frank Zappa made some of the best and worst records imaginable. I posted these reviews on Facebook every evening for the next 58 days. I’ve not corrected anything and have copied them from Facebook before they get lost in the algorithms of time, as I don’t want to do this again. So… Day 1 of the Frank Zappa thing.
