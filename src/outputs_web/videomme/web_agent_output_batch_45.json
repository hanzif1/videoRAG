Let's assume Denver consumes x avocados per year and Phoenix consumes y avocados per year. The difference in consumption is y - x. To express this as a percentage of Denver's consumption, we divide the difference by x and multiply by 100. Percentage difference = (y - x) / x * 100 Since the question asks for the percentage more that Phoenix consumes compared to Denver, we can rearrange the equation to solve for y: y = x + (x * percentage difference / 100) Let's assume the percentage difference is p. y = x + (x * p / 100) Now, we can substitute the given answer choices to find the correct percentage difference. 20%: y = x + (x * 20 / 100) = x + 0.2x = 1.2x 36%: y = x + (x * 36 / 100) = x + 0.36x = 1.36x 40%:..."

It's a bit slow and repetitive at times, but I also don't think you could have made this film any better without diluting the message behind it. However, what that message is seems to be of great debate with many top critics. The majority of critics seem to believe this film is about \"living in the moment\" or \"finding beauty in the little things\", which I guess is true to some extent, but that wasn’t my takeway at all.

When he wakes up the next morning, he hands her a credit card with 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) on it. Then he takes her to meet his parents.So far, so cheesy. But the twists keep coming in “Cleaning Mom, The Return of the Infinite.” It turns out the cleaning lady and the CEO’s dad knew each other — at one point, he had sought her hand in m..."
