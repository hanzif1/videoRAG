Question Spoilers ahead. The motorcycle chase scene and the catacomb scene has Junior moving in a weird fashion. Then in the last fight scene he moves kind of normally while the third Will Smith (young) moves like in a video game. I felt this same with the older Will Smith once in the motorcycle chase when he falls down from the bike. That's a tiny flaw in CGI I guess. But with the younger one, do they do that on purpose?

Start: Starting blocks are used for all hurdle, relay and sprint events. The starting blocks consist of two adjustable footplates attached to a rigid frame. Olympic hurdle and sprint races commence with the firing of the starting pistol. The starting commands are \"On your marks\" and \"Set.\" Once all athletes are in the set position, the starting pistol is fired, officially starting the race. For the 100m, women's 100m hurdles and men's 110m hurdles, all competitors are lined up side-by-side. For the 200m, 400m and 400m hurdles, which involve curves, runners are staggered for the start.
