He is 26 months and has recently started saying ‘no’ to all of my requests, regardless of what they are.

So, we are not sure where this is coming from. Also it makes things quite difficult. I am hoping you have some advice. One example is getting into his pj’s for bedtime. This is now taking well over half an hour because he just refuses to put them on. I am trying very hard not to force him and give him as much opportunity to do it h..."

A pseudo-scientific look at the phenomenon of the “strong” female character. by Seth Mlawski June 28th, 2010 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Rule #1 of writing fiction in the 21st century: All characters must be likable.  Sure, sure… but what does “likable” mean?  A while ago, I wrote a piece about this subject, but my findings were superficial at best.  “Likable characters have dogs,” I said.  “Likable characters are easy for audiences to identify with and pity.” Such analysis was not particularly useful to the would-be writer or to most consumers of modern fiction.  What, for example, are we to make of the fact that psychopathic k..."

Peace and goodwill to you, dear reader or skimmer! This post was originally intended to debut at the end of November* in celebration of men’s health awareness, but why not extend the celebration of men to December, the month in which we freely give thanks for the people and influences we’re most grateful to have in our lives?

Not all characters can race cars. Most of them can spectate, be a pit crew, or be crew chief for the driver. Single-player wise, the player plays as a rookie driver accepted into the F.A.R.A.

We had an innovative format at this event, with each day given over to one or two weight classes for both men and women. The masters lifted in the morning, the juniors and sub-juniors lifted in the afternoon and the open category formed the Prime Time sessions in the early evening. This gave a great mix of lifting every day, maintaining the excitement of the event, and the younger lifters got to rub shoulders with their heroes. We would like to offer our thanks to Powerlifting America for hosting these championships and to Eleiko for hosting a training hall at their athlete village, as well as a great party and a phenomenal barbecue at the banqu..."
