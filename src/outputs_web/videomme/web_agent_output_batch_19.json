Walls therefore constitute a dual representation, either as a tangible manifestation of the innate psychological need of all living beings for physical security, or as an ignominious display of the failure of diplomacy, of effective communication between individuals. The Berlin Wall, though advertised by its creators as serving a defensive purpose--to protect the Eastern Bloc from western \"aggression\"--and thus as a representation of the former function of a w..."

Designed to keep people in, the armed patrols were ordered to gun down anyone who tried to escape. With only commemorative sections remaining today, it’s still one of the greatest symbols of the Cold War.The night the Wall went upIt was in the afternoon on the 12 August 1961 that Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, signed the commands to close the border. At midnight that night, the army, police and the \"Kampfgruppen\" began to bolt the city. During the night between August 12th and 13th 1961 the wall was erected. In the early morning of that Sunday most of the first work had been done: the border to West Berlin was closed. East Germa..."

Simply draw a shape, choose a font, type in the company name and that’s a job well done, right? Actually...no. The logo is the face of your company. It’s going to represent everything your business stands for, be relatable to your target audience, use an attractive and meaningful colour palette and have the potential to be iconic. Unfortunately, not recognising the logo’s power is a mistake that many companies make. The truth is, a logo that is incongruent with your brand and doesn’t speak to your audience is null and void.

Most people know him but what has remained debated is what he’s holding in his right hand (the one not holding the sling). Statue of DavidOf course, I can’t get into anything else without my customary background. Before David was even commissioned or given to Michaelangelo, the Overseers of the Office of Works for the Florence Cathedral made a plan to commission 12 huge statues of Old Testament figures for the buttresses of the cathedral. These were going to be so massive because they were planning to put them on the roof. In 1410 they hired Donatello to create Joshua in te..."

The oldest known body of pottery dates from the Jomon period (from about 10,500 to 400 BC) in Japan; and even the earliest Jomon ceramics exhibit a unique sophistication of technique and design. Excavations in the Near East have revealed that primitive fired-clay vessels were made there more than 8,000 years ago. Potters were working in Iran by about 5500 BC, and earthenware was probably being produced even earlier on the Iranian high plateau. Chinese potters had developed characteristic techniques by about 5000 BC. In the New World many pre-Columbian American cultures developed highly artistic pottery traditions. After general sections on basic pottery types and decorating techniques this article focuses on the development of Western pottery since the beginning of the Renaissance. For detailed treatment of ancient Western and non-Western pottery, see Chinese art and architecture; Egypt..."

Ceramic and Pottery Glossary andTerm Pottery is our oldest handicraft. In prehistoric times, most likely water was carried in woven baskets lined with river clay. After the water was poured out of the container the layer of clay dried. The loss of moisture caused the shape to shrink and separate from the sides of the basket. When the clay, now shaped like a pot, was removed, and dried in the sun on hot sand, it retained the basket pattern.

Modern British & Irish Art Aug 9, 2017 A Century of Ceramics in British Art By Robin Cawdron-Stewart I n May 1940 Bernard Leach, the 'founding father' of the British Studio Ceramic movement wrote that: \"very few people in this country think of the making of pottery as an art\". But the pottery that Leach wrote of – rich with its 'own language and inherent laws' – had been a growing presence in the broader art scene since the end of the 19th Century, with the popularity of Robert Wallace Martin's famous Wally Birds, which delighted and amazed in equal measure. September's Made In Britain auction charts this journey and the changing attitudes and approaches used by artists, potters, ceramicists and makers throughout the course of the century, celebrating a century of ceramics in British art in all its glory.

As an electrical engineer with an MBA and the CEO of InOrbis Intercity, I’ve watched Musk’s ventures weave in and out of Silicon Valley over the past decade. This latest move, quietly ramping up operations in South San Francisco, represents more than a mere geographic footprint—it hints at a strategic pivot with far-reaching implications for brain-computer interface technology, regional tech ecosystems, and investment patterns.

Open Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers.

The term comes from the action of adjusting the focus on the lens, which is also known as \"racking\" the lens. The purpose of this technique is to direct the viewer's attention from one subject to another without cutting the shot. In a typical rack focus shot, the focus smoothly shifts from one object to another in the same frame. For instance, a character in the foreground might be in focus at the start of the shot, and then the focus could shift to a character or object in the background. This technique is often used in films and television shows to highlight a specific detail or to c..."

Open Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads.

By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers.

Their dance brought them closer to one another and made them spin faster, until they were circling more than 100 times per second. The ensuing collision sent a shockwave through the very fabric of spacetime, which traveled across the universe at the speed of light until it rippled through the Earth at 7:41 a.m. Central time on Aug. 17, 2017. The U.S.-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and the Virgo detector in Italy announced on Oct. 16 that all three of their detectors had picked up the ripples, or gravitational waves, from this event.

Einstein’s idea was that gravity is not a force, but it is really an effect caused by the curvature of space and time. Matter curves space-time in its vicinity, and this curvature in return affects how matter moves. This means that, according to Einstein, space and time are responsive. They deform in the presence of matter and not only matter, but really all types of energies, including pressure and momentum flux and so on. Einstein called his theory “General Relativity” because it’s a generalization of Special Relativity. Both are based on “observer-independence”, that is the idea that the laws of nature should not depend on the motion of an observer. The difference between G..."

The flag has been designed by Sir Arthur Grimble. The National Flag of Kiribati is a Horizontal Bicolor and consists of an upper half which is red in color with a yellow frigatebird flying over a rising sun; and the lower half which is blue with three horizontal wavy white stripes running from the hoist-side to the fly side of the flag. The horizontal wavy white stripes on the blue background represents the surrounding Pacific Ocean along with the three island groups that comprise Kiribati - the Gilbert, the Line, and the Phoenix Islands. It also symbolizes how the Ocean significantly influences the culture and economy of the island country. The flying yellow frigatebird epitomizes the authority, the strength, the freed..."

A remote Pacific island nation, it is a place unknown to most people I meet, and the vast majority of my American students. If they happen to have seen it on a map they will pronounce its name incorrectly — it is pronounced Kiribaas and its people and language are known as i-Kiribati (ee-Kiribaas). It’s better known in the eastern hemisphere and shares close historical and contemporary Commonwealth ties with New Zealand and Australia, who provide the country with aid, humanitarian outreach, and tourism dollars. Kiribati is one of the least visited countries in the world, yet, as its cultural landscape shows, it is now and has long been, part of a globalized system.
