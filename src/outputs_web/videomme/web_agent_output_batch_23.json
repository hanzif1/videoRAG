Poster #1 PaSCo: Urban 3D Panoptic Scene Completion with Uncertainty Awareness Anh-Quan Cao · Angela Dai · Raoul de Charette We propose the task of Panoptic Scene Completion~(PSC) which extends the recently popular Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task with instance-level information to produce a richer understanding of the 3D scene. Our PSC proposal utilizes a hybrid mask-based technique on the non-empty voxels from sparse multi-scale completions. Whereas the SSC literature overlooks uncertainty which is critical for robotics applications, we instead propose a..."

I had just been to the front counter at the post office and told the postal worker my plans. She pointed over my shoulder and said something about “over there.” I turned around, trying to act as if I knew what she’d said. (I’d only been in Taipei a few weeks, and the only thing I understood clearly was her pointing.) Behind me, against the wall, was a table with a couple bowls of what looked like wall-paper paste, with a small brush in each one. They were for sealing envelopes, since the envelope flaps in Taiwan—and I assume, most of Asia—don’t have adhesive on them. I’ve been told this is because in the high humidity, the envelopes would glue themselves shut while waiting to be used. That explanation sou..."

It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past ten years or so.It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas–oh, not the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it–overspending… the frantic running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and the dusting powder for Grandma—the gifts given in desperation because you couldn’t think of anything else.Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth.

La pregunta plantea cuántos códigos de barras diferentes son posibles con ciertas restricciones. Cada código de barras tiene un ancho total de 12, con barras negras y blancas alternadas, comenzando y terminando con barras negras, y cada barra tiene un ancho de 1 o 2. Para resolver este problema, se puede utilizar el principio de conteo. Para abordar este problema, se puede considerar la cantidad de formas en que se pueden distribuir las barras negras y blancas en un código de barras de ancho total 12, manteniendo las restricciones dadas. Se puede usar un enfoque de combinaciones y considerar las diferentes posibilidades para las barras de ancho 1 y 2. Al analizar las diferentes combinaciones posibles de barras de ancho 1 y 2 para un código de barras de ancho total 12 que cumpla con las restricciones dadas, se puede determinar el número total de códigos de barr..."

The Rentier Economy, Vulture Capital, and Enshittification There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate — died of malnutrition — because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. —John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath Introduction What Enshittification Is.

Best Television: Culinary Class Wars For the second year running, not a single scripted television program I watched could compete with the rapturous gloss, detail and complexity of a Korean competition show. Culinary Class Wars is, beyond a shadow of doubt, the best cooking show I’ve ever seen. Before its premiere, my partner and I had been watching a lot of Masterchef. We can never go back.

Her mom made her a new batch the right way.Young children have a tenancy to think that the rest of the world is exactly like their home, because that home is their world.
