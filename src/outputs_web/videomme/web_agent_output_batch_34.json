Almost all parts of a castle serve a defensive purpose and help create multiple layers of protection. Nothing was made by chance. When visiting a castle, consider why this wall or tower was built where it stands or how it used the landscape as part of its defenses. Sometimes, a castle not only uses the landscape, like a river, as a natural moat but may have also been built in that location to protect that landscape, like a strategic river crossing, or to ..."

Built in 1385 to defend against French invasion during the Hundred Years War, it doesn’t have a keep. But its walls and moat are impressive. Whether you’re into Disney movies, Middle Earth, or Game of Thrones, we all seem enchanted with medieval castles. However, while we imagine them as a fairy tale palace, they were medieval house fortresses for European nobility. Though you’ll also find castles in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Menu Skip to content Home About The Author Noble Cobra Publishing My Books Reviews Search Search for: Scene Dissection: Rattlesnake Jake June 16, 2022June 15, 2022 / DBreitenbeck Gore Verbinski’s Rango, starring Johnny Depp, is a very strange and uneven film. On the surface, it’s weird and creative, but at its core it follows a fairly strict and by-the-numbers formula, with mostly pretty flat characters living in the service of the jokes. It’s not a bad movie by any stretch, and it’s become something of a cult classic, but I’d call it pretty solidly middle-of-the-road. However, it does have some great moments, and at least one great scene: the introduction of Rattlesnake Jake. To give you a brief summary of the plot so you can follow the scene; Rango is about a pet chameleon whose terrarium falls out of the back of a car in the Mojave Desert, where he eventually wanders into..."

He tricks him into thinking the hawk is back from the dead so Jake runs away to a hiding spot. This could just be a plot development, but it could have some deeper thematic importance. The hawk and the sun are again shown together. Hawks and other predatory birds are often used to represent the Superego while snakes represent our Id.  The Id snake( Jake) must hide from  the Superego hawk until he realizes it’s just a fake so he can emerge and unleashes his fury.

Along the wild coastlines of Alaska, mother brown bears spend up to 2–3 years raising their cubs, teaching them how to survive in a world full of both opportunity and danger. We had the rare chance to witness an incredible moment that shows just how deep that bond runs. We were watching a mother bear fishing in the river, while her three cubs waded nervously along the shore. Suddenly, another bear appeared, and you could see the anxiety ripple through the little ones. Sensing their fear, the mother quickly moved to intercept the approaching bear — not aggressively, but with enough presence to push it away. Then, with a few soft huffs and subtle vocalizations, she called her cubs to her side. In a move that showed just how smart and adaptable these bears can be, the mother brought her cubs closer to us. Bears sometimes recognize that being near humans can offer a temporary “safe zone” — other bears are usually wary of approaching people..."
