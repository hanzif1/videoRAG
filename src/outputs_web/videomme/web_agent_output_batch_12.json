No U.S. men’s team qualified for the platform finals, which will feature eight groups of divers. Here’s a look at the competition and what to know. How does the competition work? All synchronized diving events in the Paris Games consist of just one round of competition with eight teams. Each team will do five dives. Two must have a degree of difficult of 2.0 and the other three have no difficulty limit. Eleven judges will score competitors on starting position, approach, take-off, flight, entry into the water, and synchronization. Scores are added together and multiplied by the degree of difficulty for each dive. The team with the highest score at the end wins gold. In the event of a tie, multiple medals will be awarded. Who all is competing? Lian Junjie/Y..."

The term comes from the action of adjusting the focus on the lens, which is also known as \"racking\" the lens. The purpose of this technique is to direct the viewer's attention from one subject to another without cutting the shot. In a typical rack focus shot, the focus smoothly shifts from one object to another in the same frame. For instance, a character in the foreground might be in focus at the start of the shot, and then the focus could shift to a character or object in the background. This technique is often used in films and television shows to highlight a specific detail or to c..."

This was particularly apparent in continental club competitions normally played over two legs. If the aggregate scores were level, there was a costly process of having to play a third match in a neutral venue in front of few spectators. At World Cups there had been a provision for replays up until the 1958 finals in Sweden, but four years later in Chile, drawn matches in the quarter and semi-finals would have been decided by the drawing of lots.</p> <p><strong>That doesn’t sound very fair!</strong></p> <p>..."

For instance, a character in the foreground might be in focus at the start of the shot, and then the focus could shift to a character or object in the background.
