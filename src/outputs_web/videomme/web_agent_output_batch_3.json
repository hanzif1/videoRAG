It seems there might be some missing information in the question. I am guessing \"bys\" refers to \"boys,\" and \"SiNs\" is intended to be \"girls\" or \"students.\" Here's how to solve it, assuming \"bys\" means boys and \"SiNs\" means girls: Step 1: Identify the number of girls and boys. Number of boys = 50 Number of girls = 25 Step 2: Write the ratio of girls to boys. Ratio of girls to boys = 25 : 50 Step 3: Simplify the ratio by dividing both sides by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. 25 ÷ 25 = 1 50 ÷ 25 = 2 Simplified ratio = 1 : 2 Click to rate:81.3(391 votes)Search questionBy textBy image/screenshotDrop your file here orClick Hereto uploadMore than just a tutor Solve math problems with the help of AI calculator and live tutors.ResourcesStudying VideosMath ResourcesGauth ExpertBrand StoriesAbout usTerms of ServicesPrivacy PolicyContact Uscontact@gauthmath.c..."

Rhino Rhino for Mac Johannes_Silentio July 3, 2015, 8:14pm 1 I have two lines (both flat on the c-plane in the Front Viewport). I am trying to connect them with a curve that would run diagonal along the x-axis and the y-axis. However, whenever I try to draw that connecting curve it goes inwards (that is, it moves along the z-axis). This only occurs when I use a curve with multiple points to connect these two lines. If I just use a straight line to connect the two lines, it’s not a problem. Similarly, if I draw a curve unrelated to these two lines it’s also not a problem. I notice that turning on planar seems to resolve the issue. Which is great but I’m hoping someone can explain to me what the situation I’m resolving actually is… that is, why is this curve going along the z-axis? Any help would be much appreciated. maxz July 3, 2015..."
