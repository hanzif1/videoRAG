Read moreThe Dragon Boat Festival, also known as Duanwu Festival, is celebrated annually on the 5th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar. This festival commemorates the life and death of the ancient poet Qu Yuan, who is remembered for his loyalty and patriotism. The most iconic symbol of the festival is the dragon boat race, where teams paddle in unison to the rhythm of drums, creating a lively spectacle. Additionally, the festival is famous for its delicious zongzi, sticky rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves, filled with a variety of fillings that range from savory to sweet.

[file photo] Zhao Mengfu from the Yuan Dynasty, Chen Hongshou of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and Xu Bangda, a modern painter, have also created paintings illustrating the Nine Songs. Most of these paintings also adopted outline drawing. It was more than 1,500 years after the death of Qu Yuan when Zhang Wo painted Painting of Nine Songs, from which we can see that the Chinese have a long history of commemorating Qu Yuan. The reason people commemorate Qu Yuan is his patriotism, loyalty and talent – all features of the ideal scholar according to traditional Chinese thought. Therefore, Qu Yuan was a historical figure commemorated by many dynasties. In 1616, Chen Hongshou drew 11 inserts within two days for Xiaoshan Laiqin’s Notes fo..."

The banana was part of an exhibition called \"WE\" by artist Maurizio Cattelan. The artwork called \"Comedian\" consisted of a ripe banana duct-taped to a wall. After eating the fruit, the student, Noh Huyn-soo, put the peel of the banana back on the wall. A new banana was placed at the same spot by the museum, local media reported. Moh's friend filmed him eating the banana at the exhibition. Videos going viral on social media show visitors shouting \"excuse me\" as Noh take the banana off the wall. Everyone goes quiet as he starts eating the banana. He then tapes the banana peel to the wall and poses with it for a moment. Noh later told local media, \"Damaging an artwork could also be seen as an artwork, I thought that would be interesting...

Considering its geometry, there will be pairs of opposite sides that are parallel to each other. - A regular hexagon has 6 sides of equal length. Similar to the octagon, there will be pairs of opposite sides that are parallel. Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of parallel sides for each shape. - For the regular heptagon, since no sides are parallel, it has 0 pairs of parallel sides. - For the regular octagon, we need to calculate how many pairs of opposite sides are ..."

This artwork was presented as a birthday gift to Emperor Yongzheng (r. 1723-1735).

When wind passes horizontally over a surface, like the top of a wing or the roof of a house, it lowers the pressure above that surface by something called the Bernoulli Effect. And while the pressure above the surface decreases, the pressure underneath the wing or roof remains fixed and higher than the surface pressure. And if the velocity of that wind is great enough, the reduced air pressure above the surface coupled with the sta..."

                "detail": "NOVA Online/Hawaii- Born of Fire/Hot Science: Do Rocks Float?/Why Study Lava? To get a good sampling of lava, geologists must carefully extract the fiery substance as it boils and flows. Reaching temperatures up to 2500 degrees Fahrenheit, lava is a dangerous substance and can burn through almost any material. Therefore, geologists collect their lava samples in coffee cans that will not melt from the high lava temperatures. Sampling from a Skylight One place a geologist might get a lava sample is from a crack in the earth through which a flowing river, or tube, of lava can be seen. This crack, called a \"skylight\", is a place where the roof of the lava tube has collapsed. Before taking a lava sample, the geologist will attempt to guess the depth of the lava flow. Usually, it's not possible to simply stand over a skylight and figure out how deep it is—it's difficult to get close enough to see much of anything, and in general this would be too dangerous. Instead, the geologist tosses a le..."

This mixture is usually made up of four parts: a hot liquid base, called the melt; minerals crystallized by the melt; solid rocks incorporated into the melt from the surrounding confines; and dissolved gases. When magma is ejected by a volcano or other vent, the material is called lava. Magma that has cooled into a solid is called igneous rock. Magma is extremely hot—between 700° and 1,300° Celsius (1,292° and 2,372° Fahrenheit).

They originate between 4° and 22° S of the equator, and between 4° and 35° N of the equator. During the northern hemisphere’s summer (July-September), most of the energy is delivered to the sub-tropical region of the northern hemisphere. The result is the development of large cyclonic (counterclockwise rotating) cells that are termed hurricanes if they form near North America and typhoons if they are formed in the western Pacific. Tropical cyclones do not, however, occur in the equatorial zone. More than two-thirds of tropical cyclones occur in the northern hemisphere and occur between May and November, when the ocean is at its warmest, with a peak in August and September. In the southern hemisphere, they occur between December and April, with peaks in January and February, where they ..."
