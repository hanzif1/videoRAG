I guess this is not so uncommon after all ðŸ™‚ When I came to Mexico, I was expecting to eat things like tacos, enchiladas and all the other dishes we know to be Mexican. But then Mike of Fearless and Far turned my world around (check out his vlogs here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Dm...). He took me to one of his favourite joints in town, the food turned out to be a little different from what I had expected. TD;DR: watch me eat grasshoppers, beetles and other insects in a video where I learn that there's much more to worm-eating than what's on the surface.
