                "detail": "GauthmathExtensionCalculatorDownloadGauth PLUSMath Resources/Math/QuestionSHOW LESS0SolutionAnswer The answer is **1/8**.ExplanationStep 1: **Rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal.** The division of two fractions is equivalent to multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by switching its numerator and denominator. Therefore: $\\frac{5}{14} \\div \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{5}{14} \\times \\frac{7}{20}$ Step 2: **Multiply the numerators and denominators.** Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together: $\\frac{5 \\times 7}{14 \\times 20} = \\frac{35}{280}$ Step 3: **Simplify the fraction.** To simplify the fraction, find the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of the numerator (35) and the denominator (280). The GCD of 35 and 280 is 35. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD: $\\frac{35}{280} = \\frac{35 \\div 35}{280 \\div 35} = \\frac{1}{8}$ Click to rate:44.3(70 votes)Search questi..."

Step 2: **Express the ratio as a fraction:** The fraction representing 5800 ml out of 4000 ml is: $\\frac{5800}{4000}$ Step 3: **Simplify the fraction:** $\\frac{5800}{4000} = \\frac{58}{40} = \\frac{29}{20}$ Step 4: **Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:** Dividing 29 by 20, we get 1 with a remainder of 9. Therefore: $\\frac{29}{20} = 1\\frac{9}{20}$ Click to rate:91.5(1062 votes)Search questionBy textBy image/screenshotDrop your file here orClick Hereto uploadMore than just a tutor Solve math problems with the help of AI calculator and live tutors.ResourcesStudying VideosMath ResourcesGauth ExpertBrand StoriesAbout usTerms of ServicesPrivacy PolicyContact Uscontact@gauthmath.comDownload App"

By Rand FishkinOctober 21, 2024 It’s no surprise that marketers, founders, and business owners are starting to ask how their brands can be returned in the answers given by AI/LLM tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. But it’s downright shocking how difficult it is to find high-quality, accurate information about how to do this. Granted, you could just ask ChatGPT (the first answer is decent, as are suggestions #2-10 to the second question; #1 is… problematic, more about that in the video). Getting to the heart of the matter, however, requires a solid understanding of how and why LLMs return the answers they do. Armed with that knowledge, we can make smart choices about where to invest our social media, content marketing, PR &..."

A doctor can put an entire patient's medical history in the prompt, a lawyer an entire case history, etc.As a professional...why not do this? There's a non-zero chance that it'll find something fairly basic that you missed and the cost is several cents.

Neural network pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun in the 80s and 2000s paved the way for generative models. In turn, the deep learning boom of the 2010s fueled major advances in natural language processing (NLP), image and text generation and medical diagnostics through image segmentation, expanding AI capabilities. These advancements are culminating in multimodal AI, which can seemingly do it all—but just as previous advancements have led to multimodal, what might multimodal AI lead to? Since its inception, generative AI (gen AI) has been evolving. Already, we have seen developers such as OpenAI and Meta move away from large models to include smaller and less expensive ones,..."

At the beginning of the video, he says he’s been able to confirm that the Magnus codename would indeed be an Xbox console SOC, with the product coming out fairly soon (2027) considering the technology this is based of (Zen 6) and it only has 8 more CUs than the PS5 Pro so he thinks it wouldn’t be a huge jump over the PS5 Pro, or at least, not as huge as we’ve seen between PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. He does go on about PS6 and PS6 Handheld later on in the video being released later with what I understand to be a more value proposition like the PS4 with better than PS5 Pro capabilities.

For PS2 games, you typically wouldn't want to do this. Instead, the functionality exists because the PS2 was backwards compatible with PS1 titles. The original PS1 controller didn't have analog sticks at all, just the D-Pad for navigation. After a few years (and the success of Nintendo's N64 analog controller) Sony released a revised version of the controller that included two joysticks, which their controllers still mimic to t..."
