Fabio Leidwein – Aug 14, 2025 Did you know that almost 20% of all football goals are scored after the 80th minute? You didn’t read that wrong, nearly one in every five goals happens right at the end of the game. So, for all those “fans” that leave the games early to beat the traffic, chances are high that you’ll miss the most dramatic part of the game. Football is a sport of fine margins. One goal can completely change the course of a game, and the timing of that goal often matters as much as the goal itself. Over the years, analysts have looked closely at when goals are scored to understand the patterns hidden within 90 minutes of football. What we find is fascinating: some parts of a match are naturally more probable for goals, while others are more controlled and defensive. In this post, we’ll explore goal timing in football, break down the ..."

In the 50m freestyle, for example, some competitors don't breathe at any point during the race. Freestyle swimming has been included in every modern Olympics. Currently, freestyle is contested in more Olympic events than any other stroke, at distances of 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, and 1500m. There are also two freestyle relay events per gender, a 4..."

China's Quan Hongchan made a massive statement with no splash on her first dive of Tuesday's women's 10m platform diving finals. The perfect forward 3 1/2 received a score for 90.0 points after accounting for degree of difficulty. From there, it seemed that Quan's only competition was her own teammate, Chen Yuxi. The two tussled for gold and silver as the rest of the competitors battled for bronze. Chen stayed within gold-medal distance of her teammate, but a final dive score of 92.4 gave Quan the gold by 4.9 points.

But Wilson’s athleticism doesn’t just end with Football. After graduating from high school, Wilson was recruited by the Baltimore Orioles during the 2007 MLB draft. Deciding to choose an education, Wilson went on to playing college football as well as baseball during his undergrad. With a short stint at playing baseball in the Major League, Wilson is a spectacular athlete who could switch over at any time.

Yet, there are those who have been blessed with an extra scoop of athleticism that allowed them to excel in more than one league. From Heisman winners in the NBA to Olympic gold medalists in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, we have compiled a list of those athletically gifted enough to achieve success at the highest level in multiple arenas. 1. Michael Jordan You could live off the grid and still know about the illustrious basketball career of Air Jordan himself. Fresh off a three-peat with the Chicago Bulls, Jordan stepped away from the NBA before the start of the 1993-1994 season to play Minor League baseball. He would later disclose that the move was prompted by the tragic murder of his father. He signed a contract with the Chicago White Sox in 1994 and played..."

In one sense of the term, ‘consciousness’ is a synonym for wakefulness. Consider, for example, the following sentence, taken from The Logic of Definition (1885) by the Scottish philosopher W L Davidson: ‘The mind’s wakeful activity is consciousness – consciousness as opposed to dormancy, dreamless sleep, swoon, insensibility …’It’s clear, however, that debates about the distribution of consciousness aren’t about wakefulness. When the computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton claims that AI systems are already conscious, he surely isn’t suggesting that they are awake; conversely, those who reject the possibility of neonatal consciousness don’t deny the..."

An ideal design of the video streaming system should simultaneously meet three key requirements: (1) low latency of encoding and streaming, (2) high accuracy of server-side DNNs, and (3) low compute overheads on the camera. Unfortunately, despite many recent efforts, such video streaming system has hitherto been elusive, especial..."
