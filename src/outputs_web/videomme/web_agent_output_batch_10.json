Step 2: Determine the number of qualified applicants, which is (4). Step 3: Use the permutation formula to find the number of ways to assign the applicants to the hospitals. The formula is (\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}), where (n) is the total number of items, (k) is the number of items to choose, and (!) denotes factorial. Step 4: Apply the formula with (n = 10) and (k = 4): [ \\frac{10!}{(10-4)!4!} = \\frac{10!}{6!4!} ] Step 5: Simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator: [ \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2} = 10 \\times 3 \\times 7 ] Step 6: Calculate the result: [ 10 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 210 ] Therefore, there are 210 ways to assign the nurses to the hospitals.

For while others speak, he watches. And while others act, he plans. And when they finally rest… he strikes” describes aptly the rise of China to the global stage when the West is sleeping on the wheel. Arguably, many of the fears about China’s rise have been exaggerated due to ignorance about the Middle Kingdom’s development process.

Since the price is £0.90 for 25 g, the price for 100 g would be \\( \\frac{100}{25} \\times 0.90 = 4 \\times 0.90 = £3.60 \\). Step 2: Calculate the price for the Spanish website. Since the price is €1.20 for 50 g, the price for 100 g would be \\( \\frac{100}{50} \\times 1.20 = 2 \\times 1.20 = €2.40 \\). Step 3: Convert the €2.40 to pounds using the conversion rate €1 = £0.95. So, \\( 2.40 \\times 0.95 = £2.28 \\). Step 4: Add the delivery cost to the Spanish website's price. The delivery cost is €0.80, which converts to \\( 0.80 \\times 0.95 = £0.76 \\). Step 5: Add the delivery cost to the Spanish website's price in pounds to get the total cost. \\( £2.28 + £0.76 = £3.04 \\).

Part II, Trees for Blooms Bret Devereaux Collections, HDTMI September 25, 2020December 23, 2020 25 Minutes This week we continue our four-part (I, II, III, IVa, IVb, addendum) look at pre-modern iron and steel production. Last week we prospected our iron ore and extracted it from the ground and did some initial mechanical processing (washing, sorting, crushing). This week, we’re going to make our way from just rocks to an actual mass of metal rather than just some metal-bearing ore. As we’ll see, we are going to do this by applying heat and (more importantly) chemistry: Note that this week is going to be spent just getting our iron ore into b..."

We received our first covering of snow for the winter. It was like Mother Nature looked at the calendar, saw that it was December 1 and said to herself, “Oh crap, I’d better make some snow!” Though it has been a while since we had a significant snow fall, the old girl managed to spread a beautiful frosting of snow over everything. This was a “sticky” snow, wet and heavy covering every twig, branch, weed and blade of grass. The woods around my home looked like the Irish lace doilies my grandmother used to crochet.Like everyone else that grew up in Western Pennsylvania, I have a suitcase full of memories involving snow.

This helps the seasoning to adhere and makes the pan pleasantly black. http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/02/black-rust-and-cast-iron-seasoning/ In a previous post, I illustrated how I cleaned and reseasoned an antique cast iron popover pan. This was my first attempt, and my seasoning technique was somewhat haphazard because I couldn’t find consistent, science-based advice. I used a combination of organic avocado oil and strained drippings from organic bacon. This worked pretty well on the popover pan, which doesn’t have a polished surface. But the smooth inner ..."

The length of the box shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. You shall make a roof in the box, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the box in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.”The Hebrew word God used for the box was תֵּבָה (tēvah). It meant a box, a chest, or even a coffin.In the Bible, it is only used for Noah’s tevah, and Moshe’s tevah, (the box that Moshe was put into when he was floated down the river to Pharoah’s daughter).

Vocal Video themes are style guides for the visuals & motion graphics in your videos. They adapt to your branding, color scheme, and any scenes your videos include. Each theme has distinctive typography, accents, scene transitions, fonts, and background music. The best way to see how themes work is to try different ones in the video editor and preview your videos. How to Switch Themes In the video editor, click the themes button on the right hand side, then simply click on the name of the theme you want to preview. As you'll see, each theme will automatically adapt to your brand kit's color scheme. Pro tip: You can also duplicate your videos and create different versions of your videos with different themes for different distribution channels. For example, you might use our default theme Europa for a full-length video but use something with more distinctive flair like A..."

Given images of multiple subjects, a reference motion video, and a related text prompt, VideoMage is able to produce videos aligned with such inputs. Abstract Customized text-to-video generation aims to produce high-quality videos that incorporate user-specified subject identities or motion patterns. However, existing methods mainly focus on personalizing a single concept, either subject identity or motion pattern, limiting their effectiveness for multiple subjects with the desired motion patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified framework VideoMage for video customization over both mu..."

Main Argument: The theme is often overlooked in filmmaking, especially short films, but it is crucial for connecting with the audience. Importance of Theme Connection with Audience: A good theme helps to communicate authentically and connect with audiences. Themes elevate a film beyond plot movements and visuals. Examples of Themes: Brotherhood, sacrifice, courage, true love. Themes are memorable and resonate with audiences post-viewing. Why Themes Matter Heart of the Film: Theme gives a film its \"heart\"; without it, the film lacks depth. Even high-quality visuals and acting can't compensate for a lack of theme.

Credit - Wikipedia User Cosmo0 There are plenty of theories about what dark matter is and how it might be gravitationally affecting the universe. However, proving those theories out is hard since it hardly ever interacts with anything, especially on “small” scales like galaxies. So when a research team claims to have found evidence for dark matter in our own galaxy, it's worth taking a look at how. A new paper from Dr. Surkanya Chakrabati and her lab at the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) does just that. They found evidence for a dark matter “sub-halo” in the galactic neighborhood, by looking at signals from binary pulsars. A sub-halo is a clumping of dark matter that is brought together inside of a la..."

Online Meetings Understanding Video Aspect Ratio by Digital Samba 6 min read Aug 26, 2025 Whether you’re posting to social feeds, creating Shorts/Reels, or hosting virtual meetings, the right aspect ratio keeps your video sharp, correctly framed, and free from awkward letterboxing. TL;DR: Aspect ratio is width:height (e.g., 16:9, 9:16, 1:1). Use 16:9 for YouTube/desktop, 9:16 for Shorts/Reels/TikTok, and 1:1 or 4:5 for feed posts.

It is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 4:3 or 16:9. The first number represents the width of the video, and the second number represents the height. The aspect ratio is an important factor in video editing because it can affect how the video is displayed on different screens. For example, a video with a 4:3 aspect ratio will appear with black bars on the sides when viewed on a widescreen display. On the other hand, a video with a 16:9 aspect ratio will fill the entire screen on a widescreen display, but may appear with black bars at the top..."

They will do so to drill up to 200 m below the seafloor at two different sites to recover a geological record of changing rock types that reflect environmental conditions at the time they formed.

As a result, journalists are contacting me assuming that the Arctic Methane Apocalypse has begun. However, as a climate scientist I remain much more concerned about the fossil fuel industry than I am about Arctic methane.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons At 10:15 p.m. on July 9, 1958, the Great Alaska Earthquake shook the hell out of the Gilbert Inlet. It occurred when the Fairweather fault slipped, triggering an earthquake that measured 7.8 to 8.3 on the Richter scale. That set off a chain of events that led to the largest megatsunami ever recorded: the Lituya Bay megatsunami. The earthquake was of the strike-slip variety, in which two slabs move horizontally beside e..."
