Lyles crossed the finish line just five thousandths of a second ahead of Thompson, who posted a time of 9.789. The result wasn't clear until nearly 30 seconds after the end of the race, as the competitors waited nervously for the details of their photo finish. When the result finally flashed on the Stade de France videoboard, Lyles' eyes bulged. He screamed jubilantly. He was a gold medalist.

We know this is true because we were double checking our information, too. There are so many fascinating components to how Lyles' win was determined and made official, from the technology behind the photo finish to which part of the body was the deciding factor. Foot? Head? Clavicle? Anything? Bueller? Here are some answers to the burning questions provided by Lyles' triumph over Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson and USA's Fred Kerley.
