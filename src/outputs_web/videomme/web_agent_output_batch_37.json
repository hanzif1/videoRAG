Always test a glaze before mixing up a large batch, or glazing a large amount of pottery in it. Mixing up a clear liner glaze is also a really great way to get started in glaze mixing, because it allows you to glaze half your pottery in an affordable liner, while still having your fun commercial glazes on the outside. Also, a good, reliable clear can act as an excellent base for a white glaze— you can add an opacifier to a clear and easily make it white. White and clear liner glazes are also good, safer options for food and drink surfaces, as they allow you to see and diagnose performance issues more easily. Happy glaze mixing! And remember, always triple and quadruple check glaze mixing information before trying it for yourself! #pottery #ceramics #potteryglaze #ceramicglaze | Pottery by Danielle"

Biology Hi, I'm Tom Mustill, wildlife filmmaker and whale enthusiast. After a humpback whale breached on top of me in 2015 (you may have seen the viral video), I became obsessed with learning about who this whale was and why it had done this.

The Short Answer: We launch things into space by putting them on rockets with enough fuel — called propellant — to boost them above most of Earth’s atmosphere. Once a rocket reaches the right distance from Earth, it releases the satellite or spacecraft. Watch this video about how we launch things into space! Click here to download this video (1920x1080, 48 MB, video/mp4). We launch satellites and spacecraft into space by putting them on rockets carrying tons of propellants. The propellants give the rocket enough energy to boost away from Earth’s surface. Because of the pull of Earth’s gravity, largest, heaviest spacecraft need the biggest rockets and the most propellent. The GRACE Follow-On spacecraft launched into orbit in May 2018.

Common Misconceptions on Japanese Grammar Grammar I’ve noticed a few posts here over the last couple days of views that are shared by others about Japanese grammar that, at the end of the day, are wrong.

Although overstated to the point of embarrassment, this stereotype, like most others, contains a grain of truth. Actually, this ridiculous stereotype can all be owed to the existence of what is known as \"aizuchi\" in the Japanese language. \"Aizuchi?\" you ask.
