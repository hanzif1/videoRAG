Members • BuddyFew3776 РусскийPortuguês (Brasil)ItalianoDeutsch What’s the most overlooked detail about the iceberg collision that people rarely talk about, but you think changes how we understand the disaster? QUESTION Personally, I think one of the most overlooked aspects of the iceberg collision is how calm the sea was that night. The water was so still that there were no waves breaking at the base of the iceberg, which would have made it harder for the lookouts to spot it in time. If the sea had been rougher, they might’ve seen white water splashing against it and had a few extra seconds to react. It’s such a small detail, but those few seconds could’ve changed everything...."

Icebergs float in the ocean, but are made of frozen freshwater, not saltwater.Most icebergs in the Northern Hemisphere break off from glaciers in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. Sometimes they drift south with currents into the North Atlantic. Icebergs also calve from glaciers in the U.S. state of Alaska.In the Southern Hemisphere, almost all icebergs calve from the continent of Antarctica.Some icebergs are small.

But if you’re drawing animals, what if you knew that you’ll use the same 40 or so pencil colours 95% of the time? And what if you knew EXACTLY what those colours were and how to use them to draw all the most common fur types?? That's where my 'Foolproof Formulas' can help you! (These are my EXACT pencil formulas for 16 of the most common coat colours🤫) I’ve developed this resource after drawing literally hundreds of pets, and just about every breed you can imagine.
