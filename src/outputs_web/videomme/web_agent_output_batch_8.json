Factual Questions Rhythmdvl November 30, 2006, 10:37pm 1 Maybe it’s just observer’s bias. And maybe I mean stage right, but it seems that every time I’ve seen a concert pianist when there are no other restrictions (i.e. he/she’s not part of a larger band), the piano sits so the player’s right shoulder faces the audience. Is this just some convention? Is it just me and the pianists I seem to have seen? Is it because the right hand gets the melody and therefore gets all the attention? (Those of us in the Rhythm section don’t know how we feel about that, but don’t want to get into pianist envy in this thread.) Could it have to do with the way pianos are built (i.e. sound)? Some mysterious piano mojo? Thanks, Rhythm Frosted_Glass November 30, 2006, 10:43pm 2 I have no clue but I am really curious about the answer to this one. I just cam..."

Unlike the dominant methods that use the bird-eye view (BEV), our proposed detector detects objects from the range view (RV, a.k.a. range image) of the LiDAR points. Due to the range view's compactness and compatibility with the LiDAR sensors' sampling process on self-driving cars, the range view-based object detector can be realized by solely exploiting the vanilla 2D convolutions, departing from the BEV-based methods which often involve complicated voxelizatio..."

A great card trick for beginners, but will amaze all of your friends nonetheless!This is the trickStep 1: The Set-up For this trick, you will obviously need a deck of playing cards. It can be any deck, as long as it has 52 cards in it (after taking out the two jokers). You are looking for the stiffest cards you can find, so it is often good to show this trick with a fresh deck, but this is completely not required at all. Just the stiffer, the better. Introduce yourself, and show your audience that you are using a full, regulation deck that has been shuffled. Step 2: \"Pick a Card\" When your audience is fully aware that there is nothing fishy going on with the deck, ask one of them to draw a card from it and memorize it. As they are looking at it, cut th..."

Menu About Search Search for: Close search Close Menu About Categories Uncategorized Beginnings and Endings in public performances Post author By metatim Post date January 6, 2022 Knowing how to start and stop If you have to give a public performance of some kind – from a wedding speech, to a presentation at work, all the way up to a play or musical performance – I would suggest that starting and stopping are the very hardest bits to get right. It sounds simple in theory, but there’s really a lot going on! Beginnings The beginning is the most important part of the work.Plato The ritual of starting a public performance of any kind has two challenges: people turning up late, and drawing attention to the starting moment.

June 3, 2020 Parisian theatre Sam Asher Share on Blog last updated on 5 August 2025. The Deeper Meaning Behind a Performer's Bow The lights go dim, and the theatre is silent as the audience waits with bated breath. Is that it? Is the show over? Suddenly, a ray of energy bursts from the stage as actors pour out in orchestrated positions and movements. The clapping from the audience fills the theatre while the performers execute their last cue for the night: they bow. An unspoken agreement between audience and actor, the curtain call and bow is the time to show thanks for the work done on stage as well as the audience for appreciating it. To an alie..."

The performer ends their dance or performance set…and then – NOTHING. They leave the stage with ZERO fanfare. The energy drops and the audience is left feeling that vacuum, and maybe they are also a little confused. The audience feels this void because even though the dancer was great and brought the energy in the midst of their performance, they ended with a low vibe like an unpleasant aftertaste. Who wants this? So, how do you end on a high note, add professional polish, and leave the audience feeling excited until the very end – the moment you are actually off stage? EXIT MUSIC!

My main thing is I want a unicycle that can go a decent bit faster because the 26’’ feels pretty slow even when I pedal quickly. I’m looking at the Nimbus 29’’ or the Titan 29’‘/32’’ from UDC. I’m leaning towards the Nimbus because I can get it with the VCS+ cranks with 150mm to 100m and possibly go as fast as a 32’’ if I get good enough? I want to be able to commute decently on sidewalks with hills but still have good maneuverability so I’m not going for a 36. Any thoughts? On a side note, is there any way to lock a unicycle to a bike rack and prevent the entire seatpost from being stolen? vtunicycle May 8, 2025, 2:39am 2 Also I’m 6’0 MrHydra May 8, 2025, 3:15am 3 Welcome to the forum!
