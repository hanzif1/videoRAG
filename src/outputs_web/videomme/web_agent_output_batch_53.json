The term comes from the action of adjusting the focus on the lens, which is also known as \"racking\" the lens. The purpose of this technique is to direct the viewer's attention from one subject to another without cutting the shot. In a typical rack focus shot, the focus smoothly shifts from one object to another in the same frame. For instance, a character in the foreground might be in focus at the start of the shot, and then the focus could shift to a character or object in the background. This technique is often used in films and television shows to highlight a specific detail or to c..."

Unfortunately, over the last few years, we have noticed a substantial drop in proper audience etiquette. We’ve seen it everywhere, including theater productions, choir concerts, orchestra and band concerts, and even sports competitions. This is increasingly frustrating to me. To emphasize my point I like to tell a story. A couple of years ago at a college football game, my family witnessed a fistfight between parents because of this lack of etiquette, which is really a lack of respect for others. An audience is a very important part of marching band, even during a halftime show. Although each spectator may be at a competition for different reasons, in the end, they are there to watch at least one specific performance. Everyone deserves the chance to be able t..."

Allow us to share this excerpt from the American Circus Educators Magazine. 1. Circus makes you happier. If you were wondering whether circus is also considered a recreational activity, you are right. And with every physical activity we do, be it practicing a handstand or balancing on a rope, our body releases chemicals called endorphins. Endorphins are released while we exercise and reduce our perception of pain. These endorphins trigger a positive feeling in the body, make us feel good and give us a positive outlook on life. A happier life is one way circus makes life better. 2. Circus builds community Circus build a community of circus performers that trust and rely on one another. Circus on a bigger scale brings ..."

By AJ Willingham, CNN Published October 19, 2020 Manipulated videos, audio and images have been around for years, but the rise of artificial intelligence and advanced editing software have made them much, much harder to spot. It’s a dangerous new world, where our very sense of reality can be thrown into doubt. Usually, we think of this deception in terms of political tricks. Several videos and images passed around during this US presidential campaign have turned out to be doctored. But the trickery goes deeper than that, and these manipulated pieces of content can emerge in unexpected forms. Telephone scams, catfishing schemes and social media trolling campaigns can all be launched with such fakery, and they can create equally unexpected consequences. Here are some tips on how to spot sophisticated fakes and keep your sense of reality aligned with the truth. Spotting fake ..."

The Baltimore Bridge Collapse was the first time I had to question whether a video I was seeing was real or AI-generated. It was 3 am, and I did what I was trained to do when you can't get to the scene. Make calls. Journalists are trained to know who to call and when. Just writing this is giving me flashbacks to my journalism classes at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. Thanks to this training, I was able to verify that a ship had hit the bridge and an active search was underway. I'm honored to be nominated for two Emmy awards for our coverage. But it's a story I wish had never happened. My heart goes out to the victims, their families, and everyone impacted. | Lindsey Mastis"
