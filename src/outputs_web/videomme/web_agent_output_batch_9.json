First is that over the last few weeks I’ve become obsessed with baked frittatas. You see I’ve always been a big fan of eggs in all their forms, scrambled, boiled and especially poached. And as much as I adore frittatas, I used to cook them only very rarely. I think this was because I always found them a little tricky. Sure they turned out OK most of the time. But I found the juggling act of trying to get the whole frittata cooked through without overbrowning, or even worse, sticking on the bottom of the pan a bit too stressful. But a couple of weeks ago I had a bit of a revelation. I was after something quick and vegetarian for dinner. There were asparagus that needed eating up ..."

I eat one as a mid-afternoon snack and my (non-vegan) husband has happily replaced his morning desk breakfast of boring ‘ol hard boiled eggs with a few of these savory babies. So, what exactly is in these? Chickpea flour is made from ground up dried chickpeas – garbanzo beans to some of you – meaning it has all of the nutritional benefits of chickpeas, specifically that it’s high in protein and fiber.  When mixed with water and used in lieu of eggs in recipes, it cooks up egg-like and custardy. I first whipped up a non-mini frittata with potato, rosemary and asparagus over at Project Juice’s Ritual Wellness blog, and I knew a grab and go version was in my future.  These ar..."

Some variation in fur colour can be attributed to habitat and, as well as smaller body size, Red foxes living in arid regions, such as in the Middle East and North Africa, tend to much paler coats than foxes from higher latitudes. Season can also have an effect and when the fox moults during the summer the longer guard hairs are lost, making the underside appear darker and the back lighter. Indeed, the colour of the fur comes from banding of pigment in the hairs. In An Irish Beast Book, James Fairley explains how fox guard hairs aren't a uniform colour: the tip 2mm or so is black, with a roughly 4mm band of red below that, and a 6mm band of yellow pigment below that; the remaining 10-15mm do..."

Step 1: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, 14x + 5x + 11x = 180 degrees. Step 2: Combine like terms. 30x = 180 degrees. Step 3: Divide both sides by 30 to find the value of x. x = 180 degrees / 30. x = 6 degrees. Step 4: Now find the measures of the angles. 14x = 14 * 6 degrees = 84 degrees. 5x = 5 * 6 degrees = 30 degrees. 11x = 11 * 6 degrees = 66 degrees.Click to rate:88.7(774 votes)Search questionBy textBy image/screenshotDrop your file here orClick Hereto uploadMore than just a tutor Solve math problems with the help of AI calculator and live tutors.ResourcesStudying VideosMath ResourcesGauth ExpertBrand StoriesAbout usTerms of ServicesPrivacy PolicyContact Uscontact@gauthmath.comDownload App"
